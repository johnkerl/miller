Dates and times
===============

How can I filter by date?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Given input like

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
cat dates.csv
GENRST_EOF

we can use ``strptime`` to parse the date field into seconds-since-epoch and then do numeric comparisons.  Simply match your input dataset's date-formatting to the :ref:`reference-dsl-strptime` format-string.  For example:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv filter '
  strptime($date, "%Y-%m-%d") > strptime("2018-03-03", "%Y-%m-%d")
' dates.csv
GENRST_EOF

Caveat: localtime-handling in timezones with DST is still a work in progress; see https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/170. See also https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/208 -- thanks @aborruso!

Finding missing dates
----------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have some date-stamped data which may (or may not) be missing entries for one or more dates:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
head -n 10 data/miss-date.csv
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
wc -l data/miss-date.csv
GENRST_EOF

Since there are 1372 lines in the data file, some automation is called for. To find the missing dates, you can convert the dates to seconds since the epoch using ``strptime``, then compute adjacent differences (the ``cat -n`` simply inserts record-counters):

GENRST_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/miss-date-1.sh)

Then, filter for adjacent difference not being 86400 (the number of seconds in a day):

GENRST_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/miss-date-2.sh)

Given this, it's now easy to see where the gaps are:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr cat -n then filter '$n >= 770 && $n <= 780' data/miss-date.csv
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr cat -n then filter '$n >= 1115 && $n <= 1125' data/miss-date.csv
GENRST_EOF
