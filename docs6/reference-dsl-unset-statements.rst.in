DSL reference: unset statements
================================================================

You can clear a map key by assigning the empty string as its value: ``$x=""`` or ``@x=""``. Using ``unset`` you can remove the key entirely. Examples:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/small
POKI_EOF

POKI_RUN_COMMAND
mlr put 'unset $x, $a' data/small
POKI_EOF

This can also be done, of course, using ``mlr cut -x``. You can also clear out-of-stream or local variables, at the base name level, or at an indexed sublevel:

POKI_RUN_COMMAND
mlr put -q '@sum[$a][$b] += $x; end { dump; unset @sum; dump }' data/small
POKI_EOF

POKI_RUN_COMMAND
mlr put -q '@sum[$a][$b] += $x; end { dump; unset @sum["eks"]; dump }' data/small
POKI_EOF

If you use ``unset all`` (or ``unset @*`` which is synonymous), that will unset all out-of-stream variables which have been defined up to that point.
