Shapes of data
==============

No output at all
----------------------------------------------------------------

Try ``od -xcv`` and/or ``cat -e`` on your file to check for non-printable characters.

If you're using Miller version less than 5.0.0 (try ``mlr --version`` on your system to find out), when the line-ending-autodetect feature was introduced, please see http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-4.5.0/doc/index.html.

Fields not selected
----------------------------------------------------------------

Check the field-separators of the data, e.g. with the command-line ``head`` program. Example: for CSV, Miller's default record separator is comma; if your data is tab-delimited, e.g. ``aTABbTABc``, then Miller won't find three fields named ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` but rather just one named ``aTABbTABc``.  Solution in this case: ``mlr --fs tab {remaining arguments ...}``.

Also try ``od -xcv`` and/or ``cat -e`` on your file to check for non-printable characters.

Diagnosing delimiter specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------

I assigned $9 and it's not 9th
----------------------------------------------------------------

Miller records are ordered lists of key-value pairs. For NIDX format, DKVP format when keys are missing, or CSV/CSV-lite format with ``--implicit-csv-header``, Miller will sequentially assign keys of the form ``1``, ``2``, etc. But these are not integer array indices: they're just field names taken from the initial field ordering in the input data.

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo x,y,z | mlr --dkvp cat
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo x,y,z | mlr --dkvp put '$6="a";$4="b";$55="cde"'
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo x,y,z | mlr --nidx cat
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo x,y,z | mlr --csv --implicit-csv-header cat
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo x,y,z | mlr --dkvp rename 2,999
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo x,y,z | mlr --dkvp rename 2,newname
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo x,y,z | mlr --csv --implicit-csv-header reorder -f 3,1,2
GENRST_EOF

Why doesn't mlr cut put fields in the order I want?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Example: columns ``x,i,a`` were requested but they appear here in the order ``a,i,x``:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/small
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr cut -f x,i,a data/small
GENRST_EOF

The issue is that Miller's ``cut``, by default, outputs cut fields in the order they appear in the input data. This design decision was made intentionally to parallel the Unix/Linux system ``cut`` command, which has the same semantics.

The solution is to use the ``-o`` option:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr cut -o -f x,i,a data/small
GENRST_EOF

Numbering and renumbering records
----------------------------------------------------------------

The ``awk``-like built-in variable ``NR`` is incremented for each input record:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/small
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr put '$nr = NR' data/small
GENRST_EOF

However, this is the record number within the original input stream -- not after any filtering you may have done:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr filter '$a == "wye"' then put '$nr = NR' data/small
GENRST_EOF

There are two good options here. One is to use the ``cat`` verb with ``-n``:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr filter '$a == "wye"' then cat -n data/small
GENRST_EOF

The other is to keep your own counter within the ``put`` DSL:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr filter '$a == "wye"' then put 'begin {@n = 1} $n = @n; @n += 1' data/small
GENRST_EOF

The difference is a matter of taste (although ``mlr cat -n`` puts the counter first).

Splitting nested fields
----------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have a TSV file like this:

GENRST_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/nested.tsv)

The simplest option is to use :ref:`mlr nest <reference-verbs-nest>`:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --tsv nest --explode --values --across-records -f b --nested-fs : data/nested.tsv
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --tsv nest --explode --values --across-fields  -f b --nested-fs : data/nested.tsv
GENRST_EOF

While ``mlr nest`` is simplest, let's also take a look at a few ways to do this using the ``put`` DSL.

One option to split out the colon-delimited values in the ``b`` column is to use ``splitnv`` to create an integer-indexed map and loop over it, adding new fields to the current record:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --from data/nested.tsv --itsv --oxtab put '
  o = splitnv($b, ":");
  for (k,v in o) {
    $["p".k]=v
  }
'
GENRST_EOF

while another is to loop over the same map from ``splitnv`` and use it (with ``put -q`` to suppress printing the original record) to produce multiple records:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --from data/nested.tsv --itsv --oxtab put -q '
  o = splitnv($b, ":");
  for (k,v in o) {
    x = mapsum($*, {"b":v});
    emit x
  }
'
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --from data/nested.tsv --tsv put -q '
  o = splitnv($b, ":");
  for (k,v in o) {
    x = mapsum($*, {"b":v}); emit x
  }
'
GENRST_EOF

Options for dealing with duplicate rows
----------------------------------------------------------------

If your data has records appearing multiple times, you can use :ref:`mlr uniq <reference-verbs-uniq>` to show and/or count the unique records.

If you want to look at partial uniqueness -- for example, show only the first record for each unique combination of the ``account_id`` and ``account_status`` fields -- you might use ``mlr head -n 1 -g account_id,account_status``. Please also see :ref:`mlr head <reference-verbs-head>`.

Rectangularizing data
----------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have a method (in whatever language) which is printing things of the form

GENRST_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/rect-outer.txt)

and then calls another method which prints things of the form

GENRST_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/rect-middle.txt)

and then, perhaps, that second method calls a third method which prints things of the form

GENRST_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/rect-inner.txt)

with the result that your program's output is

GENRST_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/rect.txt)

The idea here is that middles starting with a 1 belong to the outer value of 1, and so on.  (For example, the outer values might be account IDs, the middle values might be invoice IDs, and the inner values might be invoice line-items.) If you want all the middle and inner lines to have the context of which outers they belong to, you can modify your software to pass all those through your methods. Alternatively, don't refactor your code just to handle some ad-hoc log-data formatting -- instead, use the following to rectangularize the data.  The idea is to use an out-of-stream variable to accumulate fields across records. Clear that variable when you see an outer ID; accumulate fields; emit output when you see the inner IDs.

GENRST_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/rect.sh)
