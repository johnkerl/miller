Special symbols and formatting
==============================

How can I handle commas-as-data in various formats?
----------------------------------------------------------------

:doc:`CSV <file-formats>` handles this well and by design:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
cat commas.csv
GENRST_EOF

Likewise :ref:`file-formats-json`:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --ojson cat commas.csv
GENRST_EOF

For Miller's :ref:`vertical-tabular format <file-formats-xtab>` there is no escaping for carriage returns, but commas work fine:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --oxtab cat commas.csv
GENRST_EOF

But for :ref:`Key-value_pairs <file-formats-dkvp>` and :ref:`index-numbered <file-formats-nidx>`, commas are the default field separator. And -- as of Miller 5.4.0 anyway -- there is no CSV-style double-quote-handling like there is for CSV. So commas within the data look like delimiters:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --odkvp cat commas.csv
GENRST_EOF

One solution is to use a different delimiter, such as a pipe character:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --odkvp --ofs pipe cat commas.csv
GENRST_EOF

To be extra-sure to avoid data/delimiter clashes, you can also use control
characters as delimiters -- here, control-A:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --odkvp --ofs '\001'  cat commas.csv | cat -v
GENRST_EOF

How can I handle field names with special symbols in them?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Simply surround the field names with curly braces:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo 'x.a=3,y:b=4,z/c=5' | mlr put '${product.all} = ${x.a} * ${y:b} * ${z/c}'
GENRST_EOF

How can I put single-quotes into strings?
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is a little tricky due to the shell's handling of quotes. For simplicity, let's first put an update script into a file:

GENRST_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/single-quote-example.mlr)

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo a=bcd | mlr put -f data/single-quote-example.mlr
GENRST_EOF

So, it's simple: Miller's DSL uses double quotes for strings, and you can put single quotes (or backslash-escaped double-quotes) inside strings, no problem.

Without putting the update expression in a file, it's messier:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
echo a=bcd | mlr put '$a="It'\''s OK, I said, '\''for now'\''."'
GENRST_EOF

The idea is that the outermost single-quotes are to protect the ``put`` expression from the shell, and the double quotes within them are for Miller. To get a single quote in the middle there, you need to actually put it *outside* the single-quoting for the shell. The pieces are the following, all concatenated together:

* ``$a="It``
* ``\'``
* ``s OK, I said,``
* ``\'``
* ``for now``
* ``\'``
* ``.``

How to escape '?' in regexes?
----------------------------------------------------------------

One way is to use square brackets; an alternative is to use simple string-substitution rather than a regular expression.

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/question.dat
GENRST_EOF
GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --oxtab put '$c = gsub($a, "[?]"," ...")' data/question.dat
GENRST_EOF
GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --oxtab put '$c = ssub($a, "?"," ...")' data/question.dat
GENRST_EOF

The ``ssub`` function exists precisely for this reason: so you don't have to escape anything.

How do I suppress numeric conversion?
----------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR use put -S**.

**TODO: probably remove this for Miller 6**

Within ``mlr put`` and ``mlr filter``, the default behavior for scanning input records is to parse them as integer, if possible, then as float, if possible, else leave them as string:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/scan-example-1.tbl
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --pprint put '$copy = $value; $type = typeof($value)' data/scan-example-1.tbl
GENRST_EOF

The numeric-conversion rule is simple:

* Try to scan as integer (``"1"`` should be int);
* If that doesn't succeed, try to scan as float (``"1.0"`` should be float);
* If that doesn't succeed, leave the value as a string (``"1x"`` is string).

This is a sensible default: you should be able to put ``'$z = $x + $y'`` without having to write ``'$z = int($x) + float($y)'``.  Also note that default output format for floating-point numbers created by ``put`` (and other verbs such as ``stats1``) is six decimal places; you can override this using ``mlr --ofmt``.  Also note that Miller uses your system's Go library functions whenever possible: e.g. ``sscanf`` for converting strings to integer or floating-point.

But now suppose you have data like these:

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/scan-example-2.tbl
GENRST_EOF

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --pprint put '$copy = $value; $type = typeof($value)' data/scan-example-2.tbl
GENRST_EOF

The same conversion rules as above are being used. Namely:

* By default field values are inferred to int, else float, else string;

* leading zeroes indicate octal for integers (``sscanf`` semantics);

* since ``0008`` doesn't scan as integer (leading 0 requests octal but 8 isn't a valid octal digit), the float scan is tried next and it succeeds;

* default floating-point output format is 6 decimal places (override with ``mlr --ofmt``).

Taken individually the rules make sense; taken collectively they produce a mishmash of types here.

The solution is to **use the -S flag** for ``mlr put`` and/or ``mlr filter``. Then all field values are left as string. You can type-coerce on demand using syntax like ``'$z = int($x) + float($y)'``. (See also :doc:`reference-dsl`; see also https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/150.)

GENRST_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --pprint put -S '$copy = $value; $type = typeof($value)' data/scan-example-2.tbl
GENRST_EOF
