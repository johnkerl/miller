# Statistics examples

## Computing interquartile ranges

For one or more specified field names, simply compute p25 and p75, then write the IQR as the difference of p75 and p25:

GENMD_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/iqr1.sh)

For wildcarded field names, first compute p25 and p75, then loop over field names with `p25` in them:

GENMD_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/iqrn.sh)

## Computing weighted means

This might be more elegantly implemented as an option within the `stats1` verb. Meanwhile, it's expressible within the DSL:

GENMD_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/weighted-mean.sh)
