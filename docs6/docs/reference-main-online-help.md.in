# Online help

Miller has several online help mechanisms built in.

## Main help

The front door is `mlr --help` or its synonym `mlr -h`. This leads you to `mlr help topics` with its list of specific areas:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --help
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help topics
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help functions
GENMD_EOF

Etc.

## Per-verb help

Given the name of a verb (from `mlr -l`) you can invoke it with `--help` or `-h` -- or, use `mlr help verb`:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr cat --help
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr group-like -h
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help verb sort
GENMD_EOF

Etc.

## Per-function help

Given the name of a DSL function (from `mlr -f`) you can use `mlr help function` for details:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help function append
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help function split
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help function splita
GENMD_EOF

Etc.

## REPL help

You can use `:h` or `:help` inside the [REPL](repl.md):

<!--- TODO: repl-executor genmd function -->
GENMD_CARDIFY_HIGHLIGHT_ONE
$ mlr repl

## Manual page

If you've gotten Miller from a package installer, you should have `man mlr` producing a traditional manual page.
If not, no worries -- the manual page is a concatenated listing of the same information also available by each of the topics in `mlr help topics`.
