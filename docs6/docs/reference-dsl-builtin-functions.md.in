# DSL built-in functions

Each function takes a specific number of arguments, as shown below, except for
functions marked as variadic such as `min` and `max`. (The latter compute min
and max of any number of arguments.) There is no notion of optional or
default-on-absent arguments. All argument-passing is positional rather than by
name; arguments are passed by value, not by reference.

At the command line, you can get a list of all functions using `mlr -f`, with
details using `mlr -F`.  (Or, `mlr help usage-functions-by-class` to get
details in the order shown on this page.) You can get detail for a given
function using `mlr help function namegoeshere`, e.g.  `mlr help function
gsub`.

Operators are listed here along with functions. In this case, the
argument-count is the number of items involved in the infix operator, e.g. we
say `x+y` so the details for the `+` operator say that its number of arguments
is 2. Unary operators such as `!` and `~` show argument-count of 1; the ternary
`? :` operator shows an argument-count of 3.
