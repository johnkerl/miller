# DSL reference: user-defined functions

As of Miller 5.0.0 you can define your own functions, as well as subroutines.

## User-defined functions

Here's the obligatory example of a recursive function to compute the factorial function:

<pre class="pre-highlight-in-pair">
<b>mlr --opprint --from data/small put '</b>
<b>    func f(n) {</b>
<b>        if (is_numeric(n)) {</b>
<b>            if (n > 0) {</b>
<b>                return n * f(n-1);</b>
<b>            } else {</b>
<b>                return 1;</b>
<b>            }</b>
<b>        }</b>
<b>        # implicitly return absent-null if non-numeric</b>
<b>    }</b>
<b>    $ox = f($x + NR);</b>
<b>    $oi = f($i);</b>
<b>'</b>
</pre>
<pre class="pre-non-highlight-in-pair">
a   b   i x                   y                   ox                  oi

Properties of user-defined functions:

* Function bodies start with `func` and a parameter list, defined outside of `begin`, `end`, or other `func` or `subr` blocks. (I.e. the Miller DSL has no nested functions.)

* A function (uniqified by its name) may not be redefined: either by redefining a user-defined function, or by redefining a built-in function. However, functions and subroutines have separate namespaces: you can define a subroutine `log` which does not clash with the mathematical `log` function.

* Functions may be defined either before or after use (there is an object-binding/linkage step at startup).  More specifically, functions may be either recursive or mutually recursive. Functions may not call subroutines.

* Functions may be defined and called either within `mlr put` or `mlr put`.

* Functions have read access to `$`-variables and `@`-variables but may not modify them. See also [Memoization with out-of-stream variables](misc-examples.md#memoization-with-out-of-stream-variables) for an example.

* Argument values may be reassigned: they are not read-only.

* When a return value is not implicitly returned, this results in a return value of absent-null. (In the example above, if there were records for which the argument to `f` is non-numeric, the assignments would be skipped.) See also the section on [xxxx](reference-main-null-data.md).

* See the section on [Local variables](reference-dsl-variables.md#local-variables) for information on scope and extent of arguments, as well as for information on the use of local variables within functions.

* See the section on [Expressions from files](reference-dsl-syntax.md#expressions-from-files) for information on the use of `-f` and `-e` flags.

## User-defined subroutines

Example:

<pre class="pre-highlight-in-pair">
<b>mlr --opprint --from data/small put -q '</b>
<b>  begin {</b>
<b>    @call_count = 0;</b>
<b>  }</b>
<b>  subr s(n) {</b>
<b>    @call_count += 1;</b>
<b>    if (is_numeric(n)) {</b>
<b>      if (n > 1) {</b>
<b>        call s(n-1);</b>
<b>      } else {</b>
<b>        print "numcalls=" . @call_count;</b>
<b>      }</b>
<b>    }</b>
<b>  }</b>
<b>  print "NR=" . NR;</b>
<b>  call s(NR);</b>
<b>'</b>
</pre>
<pre class="pre-non-highlight-in-pair">
NR=1
numcalls=1
NR=2
numcalls=3
NR=3
numcalls=6
NR=4
numcalls=10
NR=5
numcalls=15
</pre>

Properties of user-defined subroutines:

* Subroutine bodies start with `subr` and a parameter list, defined outside of `begin`, `end`, or other `func` or `subr` blocks. (I.e. the Miller DSL has no nested subroutines.)

* A subroutine (uniqified by its name) may not be redefined. However, functions and subroutines have separate namespaces: you can define a subroutine `log` which does not clash with the mathematical `log` function.

* Subroutines may be defined either before or after use (there is an object-binding/linkage step at startup).  More specifically, subroutines may be either recursive or mutually recursive. Subroutines may call functions.

* Subroutines may be defined and called either within `mlr put` or `mlr put`.

* Subroutines have read/write access to `$`-variables and `@`-variables.

* Argument values may be reassigned: they are not read-only.

* See the section on [local variables](reference-dsl-variables.md#local-variables) for information on scope and extent of arguments, as well as for information on the use of local variables within functions.

* See the section on [Expressions from files](reference-dsl-syntax.md#expressions-from-files) for information on the use of `-f` and `-e` flags.
