# Date/time examples

## How can I filter by date?

Given input like

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat dates.csv
GENMD_EOF

we can use [strptime](reference-verbs.md#strptime) to parse the date field into seconds-since-epoch and then do numeric comparisons.  Simply match your input dataset's date-formatting to the [strptime](reference-verbs.md#strptime) format-string.  For example:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv filter '
  strptime($date, "%Y-%m-%d") > strptime("2018-03-03", "%Y-%m-%d")
' dates.csv
GENMD_EOF

Caveat: localtime-handling in timezones with DST is still a work in progress; see [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/170](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/170) .

## Finding missing dates

Suppose you have some date-stamped data which may (or may not) be missing entries for one or more dates:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
head -n 10 data/miss-date.csv
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
wc -l data/miss-date.csv
GENMD_EOF

Since there are 1372 lines in the data file, some automation is called for. To find the missing dates, you can convert the dates to seconds since the epoch using `strptime`, then compute adjacent differences (the `cat -n` simply inserts record-counters):

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --from data/miss-date.csv --icsv \
  cat -n \
  then put '$datestamp = strptime($date, "%Y-%m-%d")' \
  then step -a delta -f datestamp \
| head
GENMD_EOF

Then, filter for adjacent difference not being 86400 (the number of seconds in a day):

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --from data/miss-date.csv --icsv \
  cat -n \
  then put '$datestamp = strptime($date, "%Y-%m-%d")' \
  then step -a delta -f datestamp \
  then filter '$datestamp_delta != 86400 && $n != 1'
GENMD_EOF

Given this, it's now easy to see where the gaps are:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr cat -n then filter '$n >= 770 && $n <= 780' data/miss-date.csv
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr cat -n then filter '$n >= 1115 && $n <= 1125' data/miss-date.csv
GENMD_EOF
