# How to contribute

## Community

You can ask questions -- or answer them! -- following the links on the [Community](community.md) page.

## Documentation improvements

Pre-release Miller documentation is at [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/tree/main/docs6](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/tree/main/docs6).

Clone [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller) and `cd` into `docs6`.

After `sudo pip install sphinx` (or `pip3`) you should be able to do `make html`.

Edit `*.md.in` files, then `make html` to generate `*.md`, then run the Sphinx document-generator.

Open `_build/html/index.html` in your browser, e.g. `file:////Users/yourname/git/miller/docs6/_build/html/contributing.html`, to verify.

PRs are welcome at [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller).

Once PRs are merged, readthedocs creates [https://miller.readthedocs.io](https://miller.readthedocs.io) using the following configs:

* [https://readthedocs.org/projects/miller](https://readthedocs.org/projects/miller)
* [https://readthedocs.org/projects/miller/builds](https://readthedocs.org/projects/miller/builds)

## Testing

As of Miller-6's current pre-release status, the best way to test is to either build from source via [Building from source](build.md), or by getting a recent binary at [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/actions](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/actions), then click latest build, then *Artifacts*. Then simply use Miller for whatever you do, and create an issue at [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues).

Do note that as of 2021-06-17 a few things have not been ported to Miller 6 -- most notably, including localtime DSL functions and other issues.
