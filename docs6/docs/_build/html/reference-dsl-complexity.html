<p>One of Miller’s strengths is its brevity: it’s much quicker – and less error-prone – to type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mlr</span> <span class="pre">stats1</span> <span class="pre">-a</span> <span class="pre">sum</span> <span class="pre">-f</span> <span class="pre">x,y</span> <span class="pre">-g</span> <span class="pre">a,b</span></code> than having to track summation variables as in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">awk</span></code>, or using Miller’s out-of-stream variables. And the more language features Miller’s put-DSL has (for-loops, if-statements, nested control structures, user-defined functions, etc.) then the <em>less</em> powerful it begins to seem: because of the other programming-language features it <em>doesn’t</em> have (classes, exceptions, and so on).</p>
<p>When I was originally prototyping Miller in 2015, the decision I had was whether to hand-code in a low-level language like C or Rust or Go, with my own hand-rolled DSL, or whether to use a higher-level language (like Python or Lua or Nim) and let the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">put</span></code> statements be handled by the implementation language’s own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eval</span></code>: the implementation language would take the place of a DSL. Multiple performance experiments showed me I could get better throughput using the former, by a wide margin. So Miller is Go under the hood with a hand-rolled DSL.</p>
<p>I do want to keep focusing on what Miller is good at – concise notation, low latency, and high throughput – and not add too much in terms of high-level-language features to the DSL.  That said, some sort of customizability is a basic thing to want. As of 4.1.0 we have recursive for/while/if structures on about the same complexity level as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">awk</span></code>; as of 5.0.0 we have user-defined functions and map-valued variables, again on about the same complexity level as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">awk</span></code> along with optional type-declaration syntax; as of Miller 6 we have full support for arrays.  While I’m excited by these powerful language features, I hope to keep new features focused on Miller’s sweet spot which is speed plus simplicity.</p>
