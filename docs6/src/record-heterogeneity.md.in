# Record-heterogeneity

We think of CSV tables as rectangular: if there are 17 columns in the header
then there are 17 columns for every row, else the data have a formatting error.

But heterogeneous data abound -- log-file entries, JSON documents, no-SQL
databases such as MongoDB, etc. -- not to mention **data-cleaning
opportunities** we'll look at in this page. Miller offers several ways to
handle data heterogeneity.

## Terminology, examples, and solutions

Different kinds of heterogeneous data include _ragged_, _irregular_, and _sparse_.

### Homogeneous/rectangular data

A **homogeneous** list of records is one in which all records have _the same keys, in the same order_.
For example, here is a well-formed [CSV file](file-formats.md#csvtsvasvusvetc):

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv cat data/het/hom.csv
GENMD_EOF

It has three records (written here using JSON formatting):

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --ojson --no-jvstack cat data/het/hom.csv
GENMD_EOF

Here every row has the same keys, in the same order: `a,b,c`.

These are also sometimes called **rectangular** since if we pretty-print them we get a nice rectangle:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --opprint cat data/het/hom.csv
GENMD_EOF

### Fillable data

A second example has some empty cells which could be **filled**:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv cat data/het/fillable.csv
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --ojson --no-jvstack cat data/het/fillable.csv
GENMD_EOF

This example is still homogeneous, though: every row has the same keys, in the same order: `a,b,c`.
Empty values don't make the data heterogeneous.

Note however that we can use the [`fill-down`](reference-verbs.md#fill-empty) verb to make these
values non-empty, if we like:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --opprint fill-empty -v filler data/het/fillable.csv
GENMD_EOF

### Ragged data

Next let's look at non-well-formed CSV files. For a third example:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/het/ragged.csv
GENMD_EOF

If you `mlr csv cat` this, you'll get an error message:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND_TOLERATING_ERROR
mlr --csv cat data/het/ragged.csv
GENMD_EOF

There are two kinds of raggedness here. Since CSVs form records by zipping the
keys from the header line together with the values from each data line, the
second record has a missing value for key `c` (which ought to be fillable),
while the third record has a value `10` with no key for it.

Using the `--allow-ragged-csv-input` option we can fill values in too-short
rows, and provide a key (column number starting with 1) for too-long rows:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND_TOLERATING_ERROR
mlr --icsv --ojson --allow-ragged-csv-input cat data/het/ragged.csv
GENMD_EOF

### Irregular data

Here's another situation -- this file has, in some sense, the "same" data as
our `ragged.csv` example above:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/het/irregular.json
GENMD_EOF

For example, on the second record, `a` is 4, `b` is 5, `c` is 6. But this data
is heterogeneous because the keys `a,b,c` aren't in the same order in each
record.

This kind of data arises often in practice. One reason is that, while many
programming languages (including the Miller DSL) [preserve insertion
order](reference-main-maps.md#insertion-order-is-preserved) in maps; others do
not. So someone might have written `{"a":4,"b":5,"c":6}` in the source code,
but the data may not have printed that way into a given data file.

We can use the [`regularize`](reference-verbs.md#regularize) or
[`sort-within-records`](reference-verbs.md#sort-within-records) verb to order
the keys:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --json --no-jvstack regularize data/het/irregular.json
GENMD_EOF

The `regularize` verb tries to re-order subsequent rows to look like the first
(whatever order that is); the `sort-within-records` verb simply uses
alphabetical order (which is the same in the above example where the first
record has keys in the order `a,b,c`).

### Sparse data

Here's another frequently occurring situation -- quite often, systems will log
data for items which are present, but won't log data for items which aren't.

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --json cat data/het/sparse.json
GENMD_EOF

This data is called **sparse** (from the [data-storage term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix)).

We can use the [`unsparsify`](reference-verbs.md#unsparsify) verb to make sure
every record has the same keys:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --json unsparsify data/het/sparse.json
GENMD_EOF

Since this data is now homogeneous (rectangular), it pretty-prints nicely:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --opprint unsparsify data/het/sparse.json
GENMD_EOF

## Reading and writing heterogeneous data

In the previous sections we saw different kinds of data heterogeneity, and ways
to transform the data to make it homogeneous.

### Non-rectangular file formats: JSON, XTAB, NIDX, DKVP

For these formats, record-heterogeneity comes naturally:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/het/sparse.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --onidx --ofs ' ' cat data/het/sparse.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --oxtab cat data/het/sparse.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --odkvp cat data/het/sparse.json
GENMD_EOF

Even then, we may wish to put like with like, using the [`group-like`](reference-verbs.md#group-like) verb:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --odkvp cat data/het.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --odkvp group-like data/het.json
GENMD_EOF

### Rectangular file formats: CSV and pretty-print

CSV and pretty-print formats expect rectangular structure. But Miller lets you
process non-rectangular using CSV and pretty-print.

Miller simply prints a newline and a new header when there is a schema change
-- where by _schema_ we mean simply the list of record keys in the order they
are encountered. When there is no schema change, you get CSV per se as a
special case. Likewise, Miller reads heterogeneous CSV or pretty-print input
the same way. The difference between CSV and CSV-lite is that the former is
[RFC-4180-compliant](file-formats.md#csvtsvasvusvetc), while the latter readily
handles heterogeneous data (which is non-compliant). For example:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/het.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --opprint cat data/het.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --opprint group-like data/het.json
GENMD_EOF

Miller handles explicit header changes as just shown. If your CSV input contains ragged data -- if there are implicit header changes (no intervening blank line and new header line) as seen above -- you can use `--allow-ragged-csv-input` (or keystroke-saver `--ragged`).

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND_TOLERATING_ERROR
mlr --csv --ragged cat data/het/ragged.csv
GENMD_EOF

## Processing heterogeneous data

Above we saw how to make heterogeneous data homogeneous, and then how to print heterogeneous data.
As for other processing, record-heterogeneity is not a problem for Miller.

Miller operates on specified fields and takes the rest along: for example, if
you are sorting on the `count` field then all records in the input stream must
have a `count` field but the other fields can vary, and moreover the sorted-on
field name(s) don't need to be in the same position on each line:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/sort-het.dkvp
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr sort -n count data/sort-het.dkvp
GENMD_EOF
