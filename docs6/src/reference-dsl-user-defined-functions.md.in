# DSL user-defined functions

As of Miller 5.0.0 you can define your own functions, as well as subroutines.

## User-defined functions

Here's the obligatory example of a recursive function to compute the factorial function:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --opprint --from data/small put '
    func f(n) {
        if (is_numeric(n)) {
            if (n > 0) {
                return n * f(n-1);
            } else {
                return 1;
            }
        }
        # implicitly return absent-null if non-numeric
    }
    $ox = f($x + NR);
    $oi = f($i);
'
GENMD_EOF

Properties of user-defined functions:

* Function bodies start with `func` and a parameter list, defined outside of `begin`, `end`, or other `func` or `subr` blocks. (I.e. the Miller DSL has no nested functions.)

* A function (uniqified by its name) may not be redefined: either by redefining a user-defined function, or by redefining a built-in function. However, functions and subroutines have separate namespaces: you can define a subroutine `log` (for logging messages to stderr, say) which does not clash with the mathematical `log` (logarithm) function.

* Functions may be defined either before or after use -- there is an object-binding/linkage step at startup.  More specifically, functions may be either recursive or mutually recursive.

* Functions may be defined and called either within `mlr filter` or `mlr put`.

* Argument values may be reassigned: they are not read-only.

* When a return value is not implicitly returned, this results in a return value of [absent-null](reference-main-null-data.md). (In the example above, if there were records for which the argument to `f` is non-numeric, the assignments would be skipped.) See also the [null-data reference page](reference-main-null-data.md).

* See the section on [Local variables](reference-dsl-variables.md#local-variables) for information on scope and extent of arguments, as well as for information on the use of local variables within functions.

* See the section on [Expressions from files](reference-dsl-syntax.md#expressions-from-files) for information on the use of `-f` and `-e` flags.

## User-defined subroutines

Example:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --opprint --from data/small put -q '
  begin {
    @call_count = 0;
  }
  subr s(n) {
    @call_count += 1;
    if (is_numeric(n)) {
      if (n > 1) {
        call s(n-1);
      } else {
        print "numcalls=" . @call_count;
      }
    }
  }
  print "NR=" . NR;
  call s(NR);
'
GENMD_EOF

Properties of user-defined subroutines:

* Subroutine bodies start with `subr` and a parameter list, defined outside of `begin`, `end`, or other `func` or `subr` blocks. (I.e. the Miller DSL has no nested subroutines.)

* A subroutine (uniqified by its name) may not be redefined. However, functions and subroutines have separate namespaces: you can define a subroutine `log` which does not clash with the mathematical `log` function.

* Subroutines may be defined either before or after use -- there is an object-binding/linkage step at startup.  More specifically, subroutines may be either recursive or mutually recursive. Subroutines may call functions.

* Subroutines may be defined and called either within `mlr put` or `mlr put`.

* Subroutines have read/write access to `$`-variables and `@`-variables.

* Argument values may be reassigned: they are not read-only.

* See the section on [local variables](reference-dsl-variables.md#local-variables) for information on scope and extent of arguments, as well as for information on the use of local variables within functions.

* See the section on [Expressions from files](reference-dsl-syntax.md#expressions-from-files) for information on the use of `-f` and `-e` flags.

## Differences between functions and subroutines

Subroutines cannot return values, and they are invoked by the keyword `call`.

In hindsight, subroutines needn't have been invented. If `foo` is a function
then you can write `foo(1,2,3)` while ignoring its return value, and that plays
the role of subroutine quite well.

## Loading a library of functions

If you have a file with UDFs you use frequently, say `my-udfs.mlr`, you can use
`--load` or `--mload` to define them for your Miller scripts. For example, in
your shell, 

GENMD_CARDIFY_HIGHLIGHT_ONE
alias mlr='mlr --load ~/my-functions.mlr'
GENMD_EOF

or

GENMD_CARDIFY_HIGHLIGHT_ONE
alias mlr='mlr --load /u/miller-udfs/'
GENMD_EOF

See the [miscellaneous-flags page](reference-main-flag-list.md#miscellaneous-flags) for more information.
