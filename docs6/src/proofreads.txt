C sort for maps and arrays:
  o impl sortaf and sortmf
  o doc sorta, sortmk, sortaf, sortmf 
  o get call-UDF-by-name (no 1st-class for now, too much work -- so sortaf(a, "f") not sortaf(a, f))
  o flags for sorta/sortmk: f/n: lex/numerical, r: reverse, c: case-fold
    - 8 funcptrs: lex/num, up/down, case-fold/not
  o impl case-fold for sort *verb* as well
    -> 'new in miller6'
  o maximum variadic arity printed in table/olh/etc

c array+string slice UTs
! https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/653 -- stats1 w/ empties? check stats2
  - needs UTs as well

C! repifs !! https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.Split 2-for-1 -- get regexp as well ?

? nidx no output-coloring?

e fix -I + auto-decompress

? twi-dm re all-contribs: all-contributors.org

* nikos materials -> fold in

c! seps \001 etc !
  mlrc --iusv --oxtab cat regtest/input/example.usv
  mlr  --iusv --oxtab cat regtest/input/example.usv

----------------------------------------------------------------
* deduping pass!
e fzf-ish w/ head -n 4, --from, up-arrow & append verb, then cat -- find & update the existing section

* regex: more about what is / is not

c? mlr -S / -F outside of put/filter -- ?

csv-with-and-without-headers:
? shorter version for --headerless-csv-output, & doc everywhere -- -H -- ?
? Headerless CSV with duplicate field values -> typo-fix -- duplicate keys actually -- ?!?
? cat out nas.csv first
? ag -> just grep ?
l Miller handles compliant CSV: include rfc4180 link
? Regularizing ragged CSV: use regularize verb?!?

----------------------------------------------------------------
record-heterogeneity:
? --allow-ragged-csv-input: link to new flags page once it's written
l link-to's:
  shapes-of-data.md: instead, use the following
  csv-with-and-without-headers.md.in:## Regularizing ragged CSV
  misc-examples.md.in:Then, join on the key field(s), and use unsparsify to zero-fill counters
  questions-about-joins.md.in:To fix this, we can use **unsparsify**:
  two-pass-algorithms.md.in:There is a keystroke-saving verb for this: [unsparsify](reference-verbs.md#unsparsify)
  programming-language.md.in:easy for you to handle non-heterogeneous data
  two-pass-algorithms.md.in:Suppose you have some heterogeneous data like this:
? back out of ref section -- ?

shell-commands:
e while-read example from issues

C 2nd card no output b/c stats1 --fr

two-pass-algorithms:
l link to "new" verbs x everywhere possible
e section-renames for consistency
x this (or wherever ...) maybe get rid of some of the too-many examples. pick some survivors; x the rest.

reference-verbs:
E data/colored-shapes.dkvp (this page & throughout) a CSV file ...
* ... I ONLY READ UP TO CUT & PAUSED ...

reference-main-null-data:
? more variants of is_... ?
? Records with one or more empty sort-field values sort after records with all sort-field values present -> apparently not true for sort -nr
e split out h2's

reference-main-arithmetic:
? test stats1/step -F flag
? The following, however, produce integer output if their inputs are integers: + - * / // % abs ceil floor max min round roundm sgn. As well, stats1 -a min, stats1 -a max, stats1 -a sum, step -a delta, and step -a rsum produce integer output if their inputs are integers. -> test all

reference-main-regular-expressions:
? regular expressions (of type POSIX.2) -> check/update; also link to Go page
d separate escaping for "\t" etc in arg-2/regex position -- "\t"."\t" example as well ...

reference-dsl-control-structures:
e while (NR < 10) will never terminate as NR is only incremented between records -> and each expression is invoked once per record so once for NR=1, once for NR=2, etc.
E C-style triple-for loops: loop to NR -> NO!!!
? or if a same-name variable is present in outer scope then it is modified. -> check that and make sure there is a UT

reference-dsl-output-statements:
E Keep in mind that out-of-stream variables are a nested, multi-level hashmap (directly viewable as JSON using dump), whereas Miller output records are lists of single-level key-value pairs -> link to flatten page
  - old: You can emit any map-valued expression, including `$*`, map-valued
    out-of-stream variables, the entire out-of-stream-variable collection `@*`,
    map-valued local variables, map literals, or map-valued function return
    values.
  - new: mlr: lashed-emit node types must be local variables, field names, or oosvars; got map literal.
  c ?make FunctionCallsite an Emittable? does this work in the BNF?
? mlr --oxtab put -q --flatsep / '
  o 2 examples not 3?
  o why not '--flatsep /' respected?

separators:
E write up which file formats support which flags (TODO comments)
