# CSV, with and without headers

## Headerless CSV on input or output

Sometimes we get CSV files which lack a header. For example, [data/headerless.csv](./data/headerless.csv):

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/headerless.csv
GENMD_EOF

You can use Miller to add a header. The `--implicit-csv-header` applies positionally indexed labels:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv --implicit-csv-header cat data/headerless.csv
GENMD_EOF

Following that, you can rename the positionally indexed labels to names with meaning for your context.  For example:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv --implicit-csv-header label name,age,status data/headerless.csv
GENMD_EOF

Likewise, if you need to produce CSV which is lacking its header, you can pipe Miller's output to the system command `sed 1d`, or you can use Miller's `--headerless-csv-output` option:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
head -5 data/colored-shapes.dkvp | mlr --ocsv cat
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
head -5 data/colored-shapes.dkvp | mlr --ocsv --headerless-csv-output cat
GENMD_EOF

Lastly, often we say "CSV" or "TSV" when we have positionally indexed data in columns which are separated by commas or tabs, respectively. In this case it's perhaps simpler to **just use NIDX format** which was designed for this purpose. (See also [File Formats](file-formats.md).) For example:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --inidx --ifs comma --oxtab cut -f 1,3 data/headerless.csv
GENMD_EOF

## Headerless CSV with duplicate field values

Miller's default treatment of CSV data, in the absence of any other adjectives, is always _CSV with header_.
However, lots of folks think of CSV data -- comma-separated values -- as just that, values, with no header.

Here's some sample CSV data which is values-only, i.e. headerless:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/nas.csv
GENMD_EOF

There are clearly nine fields here, but if we try to have Miller parse it as CSV, we
see there are fewer than nine columns:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv cat data/nas.csv
GENMD_EOF

What happened?

Miller is (by central design) a mapping from name to value, rather than integer
position to value as in most tools in the Unix toolkit such as `sort`, `cut`,
`awk`, etc. So given input `Yea=1,Yea=2` on the same input line, first `Yea=1`
is stored, then updated with `Yea=2`. This is in the input-parser and the value
`Yea=1` is unavailable to any further processing.

Here, the first data line is being seen as a header ine, and the repeated `NA`
values are being seen as duplicate keys.

One solution is to use `--implicit-csv-header`, or its shorter alias `--hi`:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv --hi cat data/nas.csv
GENMD_EOF

Another solution is to use [NIDX format](file-formats.md#nidx-index-numbered-toolkit-style):

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --inidx --ifs comma --ocsv cat data/nas.csv
GENMD_EOF

Either way, since there is no explicit header, fields are named `1` through `9`. We can use the
[label verb](reference-verbs.md.#label) to apply more meaningful namees:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --csv --hi cat then label xsn,ysn,x,y,t,a,e29,e31,e32 data/nas.csv
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --inidx --ifs comma --ocsv cat then label xsn,ysn,x,y,t,a,e29,e31,e32 data/nas.csv
GENMD_EOF

## Regularizing ragged CSV

Miller handles [RFC-4180-compliant CSV](file-formats.md#csvtsvasvusvetc): in particular, it's an error if the number of data fields in a given data line don't match the number of header lines. But in the event that you have a CSV file in which some lines have less than the full number of fields, you can use Miller to pad them out. The trick is to use NIDX format, for which each line stands on its own without respect to a header line.

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/ragged.csv
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --from data/ragged.csv --fs comma --nidx put '
  @maxnf = max(@maxnf, NF);
  @nf = NF;
  while(@nf < @maxnf) {
    @nf += 1;
    $[@nf] = ""
  }
'
GENMD_EOF

or, more simply,

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --from data/ragged.csv --fs comma --nidx put '
  @maxnf = max(@maxnf, NF);
  while(NF < @maxnf) {
    $[NF+1] = "";
  }
'
GENMD_EOF
