# Special symbols and formatting

## How can I handle commas-as-data in various formats?

[CSV](file-formats.md) handles this well and by design:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat commas.csv
GENMD_EOF

Likewise [JSON](file-formats.md#json):

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --ojson cat commas.csv
GENMD_EOF

For Miller's [XTAB](file-formats.md#xtab-vertical-tabular) there is no escaping for carriage returns, but commas work fine:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --oxtab cat commas.csv
GENMD_EOF

But for [key-value-pairs](file-formats.md#dkvp-key-value-pairs) and [index-numbered](file-formats.md#nidx-index-numbered-toolkit-style) formats, commas are the default field separator. And -- as of Miller 5.4.0 anyway -- there is no CSV-style double-quote-handling like there is for CSV. So commas within the data look like delimiters:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --odkvp cat commas.csv
GENMD_EOF

One solution is to use a different delimiter, such as a pipe character:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --odkvp --ofs pipe cat commas.csv
GENMD_EOF

To be extra-sure to avoid data/delimiter clashes, you can also use control
characters as delimiters -- here, control-A:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --icsv --odkvp --ofs '\001'  cat commas.csv | cat -v
GENMD_EOF

## How can I handle field names with special symbols in them?

Simply surround the field names with curly braces:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
echo 'x.a=3,y:b=4,z/c=5' | mlr put '${product.all} = ${x.a} * ${y:b} * ${z/c}'
GENMD_EOF

## How can I put single quotes into strings?

This is a little tricky due to the shell's handling of quotes. For simplicity, let's first put an update script into a file:

GENMD_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/single-quote-example.mlr)

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
echo a=bcd | mlr put -f data/single-quote-example.mlr
GENMD_EOF

So: Miller's DSL uses double quotes for strings, and you can put single quotes (or backslash-escaped double-quotes) inside strings, no problem.

Without putting the update expression in a file, it's messier:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
echo a=bcd | mlr put '$a="It'\''s OK, I said, '\''for now'\''."'
GENMD_EOF

The idea is that the outermost single-quotes are to protect the `put` expression from the shell, and the double quotes within them are for Miller. To get a single quote in the middle there, you need to actually put it *outside* the single-quoting for the shell. The pieces are the following, all concatenated together:

* `$a="It`
* `\'`
* `s OK, I said,`
* `\'`
* `for now`
* `\'`
* `.`

## How to escape '?' in regexes?

One way is to use square brackets; an alternative is to use simple string-substitution rather than a regular expression.

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/question.dat
GENMD_EOF
GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --oxtab put '$c = gsub($a, "[?]"," ...")' data/question.dat
GENMD_EOF
GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --oxtab put '$c = ssub($a, "?"," ...")' data/question.dat
GENMD_EOF

The `ssub` function exists precisely for this reason: so you don't have to escape anything.
