# DSL reference: filter statements

You can use ``filter`` within ``put``. In fact, the following two are synonymous:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr filter 'NR==2 || NR==3' data/small
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr put 'filter NR==2 || NR==3' data/small
GENMD_EOF

The former, of course, is much easier to type. But the latter allows you to define more complex expressions for the filter, and/or do other things in addition to the filter:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr put '@running_sum += $x; filter @running_sum > 1.3' data/small
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr put '$z = $x * $y; filter $z > 0.3' data/small
GENMD_EOF
