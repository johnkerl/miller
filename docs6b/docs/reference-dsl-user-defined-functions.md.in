# DSL reference: user-defined functions

As of Miller 5.0.0 you can define your own functions, as well as subroutines.

## User-defined functions

Here's the obligatory example of a recursive function to compute the factorial function:

GENMD_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/factorial-example.sh)

Properties of user-defined functions:

* Function bodies start with ``func`` and a parameter list, defined outside of ``begin``, ``end``, or other ``func`` or ``subr`` blocks. (I.e. the Miller DSL has no nested functions.)

* A function (uniqified by its name) may not be redefined: either by redefining a user-defined function, or by redefining a built-in function. However, functions and subroutines have separate namespaces: you can define a subroutine ``log`` which does not clash with the mathematical ``log`` function.

* Functions may be defined either before or after use (there is an object-binding/linkage step at startup).  More specifically, functions may be either recursive or mutually recursive. Functions may not call subroutines.

* Functions may be defined and called either within ``mlr put`` or ``mlr put``.

* Functions have read access to ``$``-variables and ``@``-variables but may not modify them. See also :ref:`cookbook-memoization-with-oosvars` for an example.

* Argument values may be reassigned: they are not read-only.

* When a return value is not implicitly returned, this results in a return value of absent-null. (In the example above, if there were records for which the argument to ``f`` is non-numeric, the assignments would be skipped.) See also the section on :doc:`reference-main-null-data`.

* See the section on :ref:`reference-dsl-local-variables` for information on scope and extent of arguments, as well as for information on the use of local variables within functions.

* See the section on :ref:`reference-dsl-expressions-from-files` for information on the use of ``-f`` and ``-e`` flags.

## User-defined subroutines

Example:

GENMD_INCLUDE_AND_RUN_ESCAPED(data/subr-example.sh)

Properties of user-defined subroutines:

* Subroutine bodies start with ``subr`` and a parameter list, defined outside of ``begin``, ``end``, or other ``func`` or ``subr`` blocks. (I.e. the Miller DSL has no nested subroutines.)

* A subroutine (uniqified by its name) may not be redefined. However, functions and subroutines have separate namespaces: you can define a subroutine ``log`` which does not clash with the mathematical ``log`` function.

* Subroutines may be defined either before or after use (there is an object-binding/linkage step at startup).  More specifically, subroutines may be either recursive or mutually recursive. Subroutines may call functions.

* Subroutines may be defined and called either within ``mlr put`` or ``mlr put``.

* Subroutines have read/write access to ``$``-variables and ``@``-variables.

* Argument values may be reassigned: they are not read-only.

* See the section on :ref:`reference-dsl-local-variables` for information on scope and extent of arguments, as well as for information on the use of local variables within functions.

* See the section on :ref:`reference-dsl-expressions-from-files` for information on the use of ``-f`` and ``-e`` flags.
