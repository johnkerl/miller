# Internationalization

Miller handles ASCII and UTF-8 strings. (I have no plans to support UTF-16 or ISO-8859-1.)

Support for internationalization includes:

* Tabular output formats such pprint and xtab (see [File Formats](file-formats.md)) are aligned correctly.
* The [strlen](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#strlen) function correctly counts UTF-8 codepoints rather than bytes.
* The [toupper](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#toupper), [tolower](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#tolower), and [capitalize](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#capitalize) DSL functions operate within the capabilities of the Go libraries.

Please file an issue at [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller) if you encounter bugs related to internationalization (or anything else for that matter).
