# File formats

Miller handles name-indexed data using several formats: some you probably know by name, such as CSV, TSV, and JSON -- and other formats you're likely already seeing and using in your structured data.

Additionally, Miller gives you the option of including comments within your data.

## Examples

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help data-formats
GENMD_EOF

.. _file-formats-csv:

## CSV/TSV/ASV/USV/etc.

When ``mlr`` is invoked with the ``--csv`` or ``--csvlite`` option, key names are found on the first record and values are taken from subsequent records.  This includes the case of CSV-formatted files.  See [Record Heterogeneity](record-heterogeneity.md) for how Miller handles changes of field names within a single data stream.

Miller has record separator ``RS`` and field separator ``FS``, just as ``awk`` does.  For TSV, use ``--fs tab``; to convert TSV to CSV, use ``--ifs tab --ofs comma``, etc.  (See also :ref:`reference-separators`.)

**TSV (tab-separated values):** the following are synonymous pairs:

* ``--tsv`` and ``--csv --fs tab``
* ``--itsv`` and ``--icsv --ifs tab``
* ``--otsv`` and ``--ocsv --ofs tab``
* ``--tsvlite`` and ``--csvlite --fs tab``
* ``--itsvlite`` and ``--icsvlite --ifs tab``
* ``--otsvlite`` and ``--ocsvlite --ofs tab``

**ASV (ASCII-separated values):** the flags ``--asv``, ``--iasv``, ``--oasv``, ``--asvlite``, ``--iasvlite``, and ``--oasvlite`` are analogous except they use ASCII FS and RS 0x1f and 0x1e, respectively.

**USV (Unicode-separated values):** likewise, the flags ``--usv``, ``--iusv``, ``--ousv``, ``--usvlite``, ``--iusvlite``, and ``--ousvlite`` use Unicode FS and RS U+241F (UTF-8 0x0xe2909f) and U+241E (UTF-8 0xe2909e), respectively.

Miller's ``--csv`` flag supports [RFC-4180 CSV](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180). This includes CRLF line-terminators by default, regardless of platform.

Here are the differences between CSV and CSV-lite:

* CSV supports [RFC-4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180)-style double-quoting, including the ability to have commas and/or LF/CRLF line-endings contained within an input field; CSV-lite does not.

* CSV does not allow heterogeneous data; CSV-lite does (see also [Record Heterogeneity](record-heterogeneity.md)).

* The CSV-lite input-reading code is fractionally more efficient than the CSV input-reader.

Here are things they have in common:

* The ability to specify record/field separators other than the default, e.g. CR-LF vs. LF, or tab instead of comma for TSV, and so on.

* The ``--implicit-csv-header`` flag for input and the ``--headerless-csv-output`` flag for output.

.. _file-formats-dkvp:

## DKVP: Key-value pairs

Miller's default file format is DKVP, for **delimited key-value pairs**. Example:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr cat data/small
GENMD_EOF

Such data are easy to generate, e.g. in Ruby with

GENMD_CARDIFY
puts "host=#{hostname},seconds=#{t2-t1},message=#{msg}"
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_CARDIFY
puts mymap.collect{|k,v| "#{k}=#{v}"}.join(',')
GENMD_EOF

or ``print`` statements in various languages, e.g.

GENMD_CARDIFY
echo "type=3,user=$USER,date=$date\n";
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_CARDIFY
logger.log("type=3,user=$USER,date=$date\n");
GENMD_EOF

Fields lacking an IPS will have positional index (starting at 1) used as the key, as in NIDX format. For example, ``dish=7,egg=8,flint`` is parsed as ``"dish" => "7", "egg" => "8", "3" => "flint"`` and ``dish,egg,flint`` is parsed as ``"1" => "dish", "2" => "egg", "3" => "flint"``.

As discussed in [Record Heterogeneity](record-heterogeneity.md), Miller handles changes of field names within the same data stream. But using DKVP format this is particularly natural. One of my favorite use-cases for Miller is in application/server logs, where I log all sorts of lines such as

GENMD_CARDIFY
resource=/path/to/file,loadsec=0.45,ok=true
record_count=100, resource=/path/to/file
resource=/some/other/path,loadsec=0.97,ok=false
GENMD_EOF

etc. and I just log them as needed. Then later, I can use ``grep``, ``mlr --opprint group-like``, etc.
to analyze my logs.

See :doc:`reference-main-io-options` regarding how to specify separators other than the default equals-sign and comma.

.. _file-formats-nidx:

## NIDX: Index-numbered (toolkit style)

With ``--inidx --ifs ' ' --repifs``, Miller splits lines on whitespace and assigns integer field names starting with 1.

This recapitulates Unix-toolkit behavior.

Example with index-numbered output:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/small
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --onidx --ofs ' ' cat data/small
GENMD_EOF

Example with index-numbered input:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/mydata.txt
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --inidx --ifs ' ' --odkvp cat data/mydata.txt
GENMD_EOF

Example with index-numbered input and output:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/mydata.txt
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --nidx --fs ' ' --repifs cut -f 2,3 data/mydata.txt
GENMD_EOF

.. _file-formats-json:

## Tabular JSON

JSON is a format which supports arbitrarily deep nesting of "objects" (hashmaps) and "arrays" (lists), while Miller is a tool for handling **tabular data** only. This means Miller cannot (and should not) handle arbitrary JSON. (Check out [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).)

But if you have tabular data represented in JSON then Miller can handle that for you.

By *tabular JSON* I mean the data is either a sequence of one or more objects, or an array consisting of one or more orjects. Miller treats JSON objects as name-indexed records.

### Single-level JSON objects

An **array of single-level objects** is, quite simply, **a table**:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --json head -n 2 then cut -f color,shape data/json-example-1.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --json --jvstack head -n 2 then cut -f color,u,v data/json-example-1.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --opprint stats1 -a mean,stddev,count -f u -g shape data/json-example-1.json
GENMD_EOF

### Nested JSON objects

Additionally, Miller can **tabularize nested objects by concatentating keys**:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --json --jvstack head -n 2 data/json-example-2.json
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --opprint head -n 4 data/json-example-2.json
GENMD_EOF

Note in particular that as far as Miller's ``put`` and ``filter``, as well as other I/O formats, are concerned, these are simply field names with colons in them:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --json --jvstack head -n 1 \
  then put '${values:uv} = ${values:u} * ${values:v}' \
  data/json-example-2.json
GENMD_EOF

### Arrays

Arrays (TODO: update for Miller6) aren't supported in Miller's ``put``/``filter`` DSL. By default, JSON arrays are read in as integer-keyed maps.

Suppose we have arrays like this in our input data:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/json-example-3.json
GENMD_EOF

Then integer indices (starting from 0 and counting up) are used as map keys:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ijson --oxtab cat data/json-example-3.json
GENMD_EOF

When the data are written back out as JSON, field names are re-expanded as above, but what were arrays on input are now maps on output:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --json --jvstack cat data/json-example-3.json
GENMD_EOF

This is non-ideal, but it allows Miller (5.x release being latest as of this writing) to handle JSON arrays at all.

You might also use ``mlr --json-skip-arrays-on-input`` or ``mlr --json-fatal-arrays-on-input``.

To truly handle JSON, please use a JSON-processing tool such as [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Formatting JSON options

JSON isn't a parameterized format, so ``RS``, ``FS``, ``PS`` aren't specifiable. Nonetheless, you can do the following:

* Use ``--jvstack`` to pretty-print JSON objects with multi-line (vertically stacked) spacing. By default, each Miller record (JSON object) is one per line.

* Keystroke-savers: ``--jsonx`` simply means ``--json --jvstack``, and ``--ojsonx`` simply means ``--ojson --jvstack``.

* Use ``--jlistwrap`` to print the sequence of JSON objects wrapped in an outermost ``[`` and ``]``. By default, these aren't printed.

* Use ``--jquoteall`` to double-quote all object values. By default, integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans ``true`` and ``false`` are not double-quoted when they appear as JSON-object keys.

* Use ``--jflatsep youmd.inghere`` to specify the string used for key concatenation: this defaults to a single colon.

Again, please see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for a truly powerful, JSON-specific tool.

.. _file-formats-pprint:

## PPRINT: Pretty-printed tabular

Miller's pretty-print format is like CSV, but column-aligned.  For example, compare

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --ocsv cat data/small
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --opprint cat data/small
GENMD_EOF

Note that while Miller is a line-at-a-time processor and retains input lines in memory only where necessary (e.g. for sort), pretty-print output requires it to accumulate all input lines (so that it can compute maximum column widths) before producing any output. This has two consequences: (a) pretty-print output won't work on ``tail -f`` contexts, where Miller will be waiting for an end-of-file marker which never arrives; (b) pretty-print output for large files is constrained by available machine memory.

See [Record Heterogeneity](record-heterogeneity.md) for how Miller handles changes of field names within a single data stream.

For output only (this isn't supported in the input-scanner as of 5.0.0) you can use ``--barred`` with pprint output format:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --opprint --barred cat data/small
GENMD_EOF

.. _file-formats-xtab:

## XTAB: Vertical tabular

This is perhaps most useful for looking a very wide and/or multi-column data which causes line-wraps on the screen (but see also
[ngrid](https://github.com/twosigma/ngrid/) for an entirely different, very powerful option). Namely:

GENMD_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/system-file-opprint-example.txt)

GENMD_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/system-file-oxtab-example.txt)

GENMD_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/system-file-ojson-example.txt)

## Markdown tabular

Markdown format looks like this:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --omd cat data/small
GENMD_EOF

which renders like this when dropped into various web tools (e.g. github comments):

![pix/omd.png](pix/omd.png)

As of Miller 4.3.0, markdown format is supported only for output, not input.

## Data-conversion keystroke-savers

While you can do format conversion using ``mlr --icsv --ojson cat myfile.csv``, there are also keystroke-savers for this purpose, such as ``mlr --c2j cat myfile.csv``.  For a complete list:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help format-conversion
GENMD_EOF

## Autodetect of line endings

Default line endings (``--irs`` and ``--ors``) are ``'auto'`` which means **autodetect from the input file format**, as long as the input file(s) have lines ending in either LF (also known as linefeed, ``'\n'``, ``0x0a``, Unix-style) or CRLF (also known as carriage-return/linefeed pairs, ``'\r\n'``, ``0x0d 0x0a``, Windows style).

**If both IRS and ORS are auto (which is the default) then LF input will lead to LF output and CRLF input will lead to CRLF output, regardless of the platform you're running on.**

The line-ending autodetector triggers on the first line ending detected in the input stream. E.g. if you specify a CRLF-terminated file on the command line followed by an LF-terminated file then autodetected line endings will be CRLF.

If you use ``--ors {something else}`` with (default or explicitly specified) ``--irs auto`` then line endings are autodetected on input and set to what you specify on output.

If you use ``--irs {something else}`` with (default or explicitly specified) ``--ors auto`` then the output line endings used are LF on Unix/Linux/BSD/MacOSX, and CRLF on Windows.

See also :ref:`reference-separators` for more information about record/field/pair separators.

## Comments in data

You can include comments within your data files, and either have them ignored, or passed directly through to the standard output as soon as they are encountered:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr help comments-in-data
GENMD_EOF

Examples:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/budget.csv
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --skip-comments --icsv --opprint sort -nr quantity data/budget.csv
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr --pass-comments --icsv --opprint sort -nr quantity data/budget.csv
GENMD_EOF
