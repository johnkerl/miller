# Reference: then-chaining

In accord with the `Unix philosophy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy>`_, you can pipe data into or out of Miller. For example:

GENMD_SHOW_COMMAND
mlr cut --complement -f os_version *.dat | mlr sort -f hostname,uptime
GENMD_EOF

You can, if you like, instead simply chain commands together using the ``then`` keyword:

GENMD_SHOW_COMMAND
mlr cut --complement -f os_version then sort -f hostname,uptime *.dat
GENMD_EOF

(You can precede the very first verb with ``then``, if you like, for symmetry.)

Here's a performance comparison:

GENMD_INCLUDE_ESCAPED(data/then-chaining-performance.txt)

There are two reasons to use then-chaining: one is for performance, although I don't expect this to be a win in all cases.  Using then-chaining avoids redundant string-parsing and string-formatting at each pipeline step: instead input records are parsed once, they are fed through each pipeline stage in memory, and then output records are formatted once. On the other hand, Miller is single-threaded, while modern systems are usually multi-processor, and when streaming-data programs operate through pipes, each one can use a CPU.  Rest assured you get the same results either way.

The other reason to use then-chaining is for simplicity: you don't have re-type formatting flags (e.g. ``--csv --fs tab``) at every pipeline stage.
