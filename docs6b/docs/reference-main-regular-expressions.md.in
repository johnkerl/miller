# Reference: regular expressions

Miller lets you use regular expressions (of type POSIX.2) in the following contexts:

* In ``mlr filter`` with ``=~`` or ``!=~``, e.g. ``mlr filter '$url =~ "http.*com"'``

* In ``mlr put`` with ``sub`` or ``gsub``, e.g. ``mlr put '$url = sub($url, "http.*com", "")'``

* In ``mlr having-fields``, e.g. ``mlr having-fields --any-matching '^sda[0-9]'``

* In ``mlr cut``, e.g. ``mlr cut -r -f '^status$,^sda[0-9]'``

* In ``mlr rename``, e.g. ``mlr rename -r '^(sda[0-9]).*$,dev/\1'``

* In ``mlr grep``, e.g. ``mlr --csv grep 00188555487 myfiles*.csv``

Points demonstrated by the above examples:

* There are no implicit start-of-string or end-of-string anchors; please use ``^`` and/or ``$`` explicitly.

* Miller regexes are wrapped with double quotes rather than slashes.

* The ``i`` after the ending double quote indicates a case-insensitive regex.

* Capture groups are wrapped with ``(...)`` rather than ``\(...\)``; use ``\(`` and ``\)`` to match against parentheses.

For ``filter`` and ``put``, if the regular expression is a string literal (the normal case), it is precompiled at process start and reused thereafter, which is efficient. If the regular expression is a more complex expression, including string concatenation using ``.``, or a column name (in which case you can take regular expressions from input data!), then regexes are compiled on each record which works but is less efficient. As well, in this case there is no way to specify case-insensitive matching.

Example:

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
cat data/regex-in-data.dat
GENMD_EOF

GENMD_RUN_COMMAND
mlr filter '$name =~ $regex' data/regex-in-data.dat
GENMD_EOF

## Regex captures

Regex captures of the form ``\0`` through ``\9`` are supported as

* Captures have in-function context for ``sub`` and ``gsub``. For example, the first ``\1,\2`` pair belong to the first ``sub`` and the second ``\1,\2`` pair belong to the second ``sub``:

GENMD_SHOW_COMMAND
mlr put '$b = sub($a, "(..)_(...)", "\2-\1"); $c = sub($a, "(..)_(.)(..)", ":\1:\2:\3")'
GENMD_EOF

* Captures endure for the entirety of a ``put`` for the ``=~`` and ``!=~`` operators. For example, here the ``\1,\2`` are set by the ``=~`` operator and are used by both subsequent assignment statements:

GENMD_SHOW_COMMAND
mlr put '$a =~ "(..)_(....); $b = "left_\1"; $c = "right_\2"'
GENMD_EOF

* The captures are not retained across multiple puts. For example, here the ``\1,\2`` won't be expanded from the regex capture:

GENMD_SHOW_COMMAND
mlr put '$a =~ "(..)_(....)' then {... something else ...} then put '$b = "left_\1"; $c = "right_\2"'
GENMD_EOF

* Captures are ignored in ``filter`` for the ``=~`` and ``!=~`` operators. For example, there is no mechanism provided to refer to the first ``(..)`` as ``\1`` or to the second ``(....)`` as ``\2`` in the following filter statement:

GENMD_CARDIFY
mlr filter '$a =~ "(..)_(....)'
GENMD_EOF

* Up to nine matches are supported: ``\1`` through ``\9``, while ``\0`` is the entire match string; ``\15`` is treated as ``\1`` followed by an unrelated ``5``.
