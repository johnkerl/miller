// Since Go is concurrent, the context struct (AWK-like variables such as
// FILENAME, NF, NF, FNR, etc.) needs to be duplicated and passed through the
// channels along with each record.
//
// * Record-readers update FILENAME, FILENUM, NF, NR, FNR within context structs.
//
// * Record-transformers can read these from the context structs.
//
// * Record-writers don't need them (OPS et al. are already in the
//   writer-options struct). However, we have chained transformers using the
//   'then' command-line syntax. This means a given transformer might be piping
//   its output to a record-writer, or another transformer. So, the
//   record-and-context pair goes to the record-writers even though they don't
//   need the contexts.
