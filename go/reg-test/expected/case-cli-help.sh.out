Options:
-h|--help Show this message.
================================================================
Usage: mlr clean-whitespace [options]
For each record, for each field in the record, whitespace-cleans the keys and/or
values. Whitespace-cleaning entails stripping leading and trailing whitespace,
and replacing multiple whitespace with singles. For finer-grained control,
please see the DSL functions lstrip, rstrip, strip, collapse_whitespace,
and clean_whitespace.

Options:
-k|--keys-only    Do not touch values.
-v|--values-only  Do not touch keys.
It is an error to specify -k as well as -v -- to clean keys and values,
leave off -k as well as -v.

================================================================
Usage: mlr count-distinct [options]
Prints number of records having distinct values for specified field names.
Same as uniq -c.

Options:
-f {a,b,c}    Field names for distinct count.
-n            Show only the number of distinct values. Not compatible with -u.
-o {name}     Field name for output count. Default "count".
              Ignored with -u.
-u            Do unlashed counts for multiple field names. With -f a,b and
              without -u, computes counts for distinct combinations of a
              and b field values. With -f a,b and with -u, computes counts
              for distinct a field values and counts for distinct b field
              values separately.
================================================================
Usage: mlr count [options]
Prints number of records, optionally grouped by distinct values for specified field names.
Options:
-g {a,b,c} Optional group-by-field names for counts, e.g. a,b,c

the number of other records having the same group-by field values.
Options:
-g {a,b,c} Group-by-field names for counts, e.g. a,b,c
-o {name} Field name for output-counts. Defaults to "count".
-h|--help Show this message.
================================================================
Usage: mlr cut [options]
Passes through input records with specified fields included/excluded.
Options:
 -f {a,b,c} Comma-separated field names for cut, e.g. a,b,c.
 -o Retain fields in the order specified here in the argument list.
    Default is to retain them in the order found in the input data.
 -x|--complement  Exclude, rather than include, field names specified by -f.
 -r Treat field names as regular expressions. "ab", "a.*b" will
   match any field name containing the substring "ab" or matching
   "a.*b", respectively; anchors of the form "^ab$", "^a.*b$" may
   be used. The -o flag is ignored when -r is present.
-h|--help Show this message.
Examples:
  mlr cut -f hostname,status

Usage: mlr fill-down [options]
If a given record has a missing value for a given field, fill that from

the corresponding value from a previous record, if any.
By default, a 'missing' field either is absent, or has the empty-string value.
With -a, a field is 'missing' only if it is absent.

Options:
 -a|--only-if-absent If a given record has a missing value for a given field,
     fill that from the corresponding value from a previous record, if any.
     By default, a 'missing' field either is absent, or has the empty-string value.
     With -a, a field is 'missing' only if it is absent.
 -f  Field names for fill-down.
-h|--help Show this message.
================================================================
Usage: mlr filter [options] {DSL expression}
Options:
-f {file name} File containing a DSL expression.

-e {expression} You can use this after -f to add an expression. Example use
   case: define functions/subroutines in a file you specify with -f, then call
   them with an expression you specify with -e.

(If you mix -e and -f then the expressions are evaluated in the order encountered.
Since the expression pieces are simply concatenated, please be sure to use intervening
semicolons to separate expressions.)

-s name=value: Predefines out-of-stream variable @name to have 
    Thus mlr put -s foo=97 '$column += @foo' is like
    mlr put 'begin {@foo = 97} $column += @foo'.
    The value part is subject to type-inferencing.
    May be specified more than once, e.g. -s name1=value1 -s name2=value2.
    Note: the value may be an environment variable, e.g. -s sequence=$SEQUENCE

-x (default false) Prints records for which {expression} evaluates to false, not true,
   i.e. invert the sense of the filter expression.

-q Does not include the modified record in the output stream.
   Useful for when all desired output is in begin and/or end blocks.

-S and -F: There are no-ops in Miller 6 and above, since now type-inferencing is done
   by the record-readers before filter/put is executed. Supported as no-op pass-through
   flags for backward compatibility.

-h|--help Show this message.

Parser-info options:

-w Print warnings about things like uninitialized variables.

-W Same as -w, but exit the process if there are any warnings.

-p Prints the expressions's AST (abstract syntax tree), which gives full
  transparency on the precedence and associativity rules of Miller's grammar,
  to stdout.

-d Like -p but uses a parenthesized-expression format for the AST.

-D Like -d but with output all on one line.

-E Echo DSL expression before printing parse-tree

-v Same as -E -p.

-X Exit after parsing but before stream-processing. Useful with -v/-d/-D, if you
   only want to look at parser information.
================================================================
Usage: mlr flatten [options]
Flattens multi-level maps to single-level ones. Example: field with name 'a'
and value '{"b": { "c": 4 }}' becomes name 'a:b:c' and value 4.
Options:
-f Comma-separated list of field names to flatten (default all).
-s Separator, defaulting to mlr --oflatsep value.
-h|--help Show this message.
================================================================
Usage: mlr fraction [options]
For each record's value in specified fields, computes the ratio of that
value to the sum of values in that field over all input records.
E.g. with input records  x=1  x=2  x=3  and  x=4, emits output records
x=1,x_fraction=0.1  x=2,x_fraction=0.2  x=3,x_fraction=0.3  and  x=4,x_fraction=0.4

Note: this is internally a two-pass algorithm: on the first pass it retains
input records and accumulates sums; on the second pass it computes quotients
and emits output records. This means it produces no output until all input is read.

Options:
-f {a,b,c}    Field name(s) for fraction calculation
-g {d,e,f}    Optional group-by-field name(s) for fraction counts
-p            Produce percents [0..100], not fractions [0..1]. Output field names
              end with "_percent" rather than "_fraction"
-c            Produce cumulative distributions, i.e. running sums: each output
              value folds in the sum of the previous for the specified group
              E.g. with input records  x=1  x=2  x=3  and  x=4, emits output records
              x=1,x_cumulative_fraction=0.1  x=2,x_cumulative_fraction=0.3
              x=3,x_cumulative_fraction=0.6  and  x=4,x_cumulative_fraction=1.0
================================================================
Usage: mlr gap [options]
Emits an empty record every n records, or when certain values change.
Options:
Emits an empty record every n records, or when certain values change.
-g {a,b,c} Print a gap whenever values of these fields (e.g. a,b,c) changes.
-n {n} Print a gap every n records.
One of -f or -g is required.
-n is ignored if -g is present.
-h|--help Show this message.
================================================================
Usage: mlr grep [options] {regular expression}
Passes through records which match the regular expression.
Options:
-i  Use case-insensitive search.
-v  Invert: pass through records which do not match the regex.
-h|--help Show this message.
Note that "mlr filter" is more powerful, but requires you to know field names.
By contrast, "mlr grep" allows you to regex-match the entire record. It does
this by formatting each record in memory as DKVP, using command-line-specified
ORS/OFS/OPS, and matching the resulting line against the regex specified
here. In particular, the regex is not applied to the input stream: if you
have CSV with header line "x,y,z" and data line "1,2,3" then the regex will
be matched, not against either of these lines, but against the DKVP line
"x=1,y=2,z=3".  Furthermore, not all the options to system grep are supported,
and this command is intended to be merely a keystroke-saver. To get all the
features of system grep, you can do
  "mlr --odkvp ... | grep ... | mlr --idkvp ..."

  --at-most       {comma-separated names}
  --all-matching  {regular expression}
  --any-matching  {regular expression}
  --none-matching {regular expression}
Examples:
  mlr having-fields --which-are amount,status,owner
  mlr having-fields --any-matching 'sda[0-9]'
  mlr having-fields --any-matching '"sda[0-9]"'
  mlr having-fields --any-matching '"sda[0-9]"i' (this is case-insensitive)
================================================================
Usage: mlr head [options]
Passes through the first n records, optionally by category.
Options:
-g {a,b,c} Optional group-by-field names for head counts, e.g. a,b,c.
-n {n} Head-count to print. Default 10.

================================================================
Usage: mlr join [options]
Joins records from specified left file name with records from all file names
at the end of the Miller argument list.
Functionality is essentially the same as the system "join" command, but for
record streams.
Options:
  -f {left file name}
  -j {a,b,c}   Comma-separated join-field names for output
  -l {a,b,c}   Comma-separated join-field names for left input file;
               defaults to -j values if omitted.

  --np         Do not emit paired records
  --ul         Emit unpaired records from the left file
  --ur         Emit unpaired records from the right file(s)
  -s|--sorted-input  Require sorted input: records must be sorted
               lexically by their join-field names, else not all records will
               be paired. The only likely use case for this is with a left
               file which is too big to fit into system memory otherwise.
  -u           Enable unsorted input. (This is the default even without -u.)
               In this case, the entire left file will be loaded into memory.
  --prepipe {command} As in main input options; see mlr --help for details.
               If you wish to use a prepipe command for the main input as well
               as here, it must be specified there as well as here.
-h|--help Show this message.

Example: mlr stats1 -a min,p10,p50,p90,max -f value -g size,shape
 mlr stats1
Example: mlr stats1 -a count,mode -f size
 mlr stats1
Example: mlr stats1 -a count,mode -f size -g shape
 mlr stats1
Example: mlr stats1 -a count,mode --fr '^[a-h].*$' -gr '^k.*$'
 mlr stats1
        This computes count and mode statistics on all field names beginning
         with a through h, grouped by all field names starting with k.

Notes:
* p50 and median are synonymous.
* min and max output the same results as p0 and p100, respectively, but use
  less memory.
* String-valued data make sense unless arithmetic on them is required,
  e.g. for sum, mean, interpolated percentiles, etc. In case of mixed data,
  numbers are less than strings.
* count and mode allow text input; the rest require numeric input.
  In particular, 1 and 1.0 are distinct text for count and mode.
* When there are mode ties, the first-encountered datum wins.

Usage: mlr step [options]
Computes values dependent on the previous record, optionally grouped by category.
Options:
-a {delta,rsum,...}   Names of steppers: comma-separated, one or more of:
  delta    Compute differences in field(s) between successive records
  shift    Include value(s) in field(s) from previous record, if any
  from-first Compute differences in field(s) from first record
  ratio    Compute ratios in field(s) between successive records
  rsum     Compute running sums of field(s) between successive records
  counter  Count instances of field(s) between successive records
  ewma     Exponentially weighted moving average over successive records

-f {a,b,c} Value-field names on which to compute statistics
-g {d,e,f} Optional group-by-field names
-F         Computes integerable things (e.g. counter) in floating point.
           As of Miller 6 this happens automatically, but the flag is accepted
           as a no-op for backward compatibility with Miller 5 and below.
-d {x,y,z} Weights for ewma. 1 means current sample gets all weight (no
           smoothing), near under under 1 is light smoothing, near over 0 is
           heavy smoothing. Multiple weights may be specified, e.g.
           "mlr step -a ewma -f sys_load -d 0.01,0.1,0.9". Default if omitted
           is "-d 0.5".
-o {a,b,c} Custom suffixes for EWMA output fields. If omitted, these default to
           the -d values. If supplied, the number of -o values must be the same
           as the number of -d values.

Examples:
  mlr step -a rsum -f request_size
  mlr step -a delta -f request_size -g hostname
  mlr step -a ewma -d 0.1,0.9 -f x,y
  mlr step -a ewma -d 0.1,0.9 -o smooth,rough -f x,y
  mlr step -a ewma -d 0.1,0.9 -o smooth,rough -f x,y -g group_name

Usage: mlr tac [options]
Prints records in reverse order from the order in which they were encountered.
Options:
-h|--help Show this message.
================================================================
Usage: mlr tail [options]
Passes through the last n records, optionally by category.
Options:
-g {a,b,c} Optional group-by-field names for head counts, e.g. a,b,c.
-n {n} Head-count to print. Default 10.
-h|--help Show this message.
================================================================
Usage: mlr tee [options] {filename}
Options:
-a    Append to existing file, if any, rather than overwriting.
-p    Treat filename as a pipe-to command.
Any of the output-format command-line flags (see mlr -h). Example: using
  mlr --icsv --opprint put '...' then tee --ojson ./mytap.dat then stats1 ...
the input is CSV, the output is pretty-print tabular, but the tee-file output
is written in JSON format.

================================================================
Usage: mlr unflatten [options]
Reverses flatten. Example: field with name 'a:b:c' and value 4
becomes name 'a' and value '{"b": { "c": 4 }}'.
Options:
-f {a,b,c} Comma-separated list of field names to unflatten (default all).
-s {string} Separator, defaulting to mlr --oflatsep value.
-h|--help Show this message.
================================================================
Usage: mlr uniq [options]
Prints distinct values for specified field names. With -c, same as
count-distinct. For uniq, -f is a synonym for -g.

Options:
-g {d,e,f}    Group-by-field names for uniq counts.
-c            Show repeat counts in addition to unique values.
-n            Show only the number of distinct values.
-o {name}     Field name for output count. Default "count".
-a            Output each unique record only once. Incompatible with -g.
              With -c, produces unique records, with repeat counts for each.
              With -n, produces only one record which is the unique-record count.
              With neither -c nor -n, produces unique records.
================================================================
Usage: mlr unsparsify [options]
Prints records with the union of field names over all input records.
For field names absent in a given record but present in others, fills in
a value. This verb retains all input before producing any output.
Options:
--fill-with {filler string}  What to fill absent fields with. Defaults to
                             the empty string.
-f {a,b,c} Specify field names to be operated on. Any other fields won't be
           modified, and operation will be streaming.
-h|--help  Show this message.
Example: if the input is two records, one being 'a=1,b=2' and the other
being 'b=3,c=4', then the output is the two records 'a=1,b=2,c=' and
'a=,b=3,c=4'.
