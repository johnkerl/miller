================================================================
Usage: mlr bar [options]
Replaces a numeric field with a number of asterisks, allowing for cheesy
bar plots. These align best with --opprint or --oxtab output format.
Options:
-f   {a,b,c}      Field names to convert to bars.
--lo {lo}         Lower-limit value for min-width bar: default '0.000000'.
--hi {hi}         Upper-limit value for max-width bar: default '100.000000'.
-w   {n}          Bar-field width: default '40'.
--auto            Automatically computes limits, ignoring --lo and --hi.
                  Holds all records in memory before producing any output.
-c   {character}  Fill character: default '*'.
-x   {character}  Out-of-bounds character: default '#'.
-b   {character}  Blank character: default '.'.
Nominally the fill, out-of-bounds, and blank characters will be strings of length 1.
However you can make them all longer if you so desire.

Usage: mlr bootstrap [options]
Emits an n-sample, with replacement, of the input records.
See also mlr sample and mlr shuffle.
Options:
 -n Number of samples to output. Defaults to number of input records.
    Must be non-negative.
-h|--help Show this message.

================================================================
Usage: mlr cat [options]
Passes input records directly to output. Most useful for format conversion.
Options:
-n         Prepend field "n" to each record with record-counter starting at 1.
-N {name}  Prepend field {name} to each record with record-counter starting at 1.
-g {a,b,c} Optional group-by-field names for counters, e.g. a,b,c

Useful for doing a well-formatted check on input data.
Options:
-h|--help Show this message.

================================================================
Usage: mlr clean-whitespace [options]
For each record, for each field in the record, whitespace-cleans the keys and/or
values. Whitespace-cleaning entails stripping leading and trailing whitespace,
and replacing multiple whitespace with singles. For finer-grained control,
please see the DSL functions lstrip, rstrip, strip, collapse_whitespace,
and clean_whitespace.

Options:
-k|--keys-only    Do not touch values.
-v|--values-only  Do not touch keys.
It is an error to specify -k as well as -v -- to clean keys and values,
leave off -k as well as -v.

================================================================
Usage: mlr count-distinct [options]
Prints number of records having distinct values for specified field names.
Same as uniq -c.

Options:
-f {a,b,c}    Field names for distinct count.
-n            Show only the number of distinct values. Not compatible with -u.
-o {name}     Field name for output count. Default "count".
              Ignored with -u.
-u            Do unlashed counts for multiple field names. With -f a,b and
              without -u, computes counts for distinct combinations of a
              and b field values. With -f a,b and with -u, computes counts
              for distinct a field values and counts for distinct b field
              values separately.

================================================================
Usage: mlr count [options]
Prints number of records, optionally grouped by distinct values for specified field names.
Options:
-g {a,b,c} Optional group-by-field names for counts, e.g. a,b,c
-n {n} Show only the number of distinct values. Not interesting without -g.
-o {name} Field name for output-count. Default "count".
-h|--help Show this message.

================================================================
Usage: mlr count-similar [options]
Ingests all records, then emits each record augmented by a count of
the number of other records having the same group-by field values.
Options:
-g {a,b,c} Group-by-field names for counts, e.g. a,b,c
-o {name} Field name for output-counts. Defaults to "count".
-h|--help Show this message.

================================================================
Usage: mlr cut [options]
Passes through input records with specified fields included/excluded.
Options:
 -f {a,b,c} Comma-separated field names for cut, e.g. a,b,c.
 -o Retain fields in the order specified here in the argument list.
    Default is to retain them in the order found in the input data.
 -x|--complement  Exclude, rather than include, field names specified by -f.
 -r Treat field names as regular expressions. "ab", "a.*b" will
   match any field name containing the substring "ab" or matching
   "a.*b", respectively; anchors of the form "^ab$", "^a.*b$" may
   be used. The -o flag is ignored when -r is present.

================================================================
Usage: mlr fill-down [options]
If a given record has a missing value for a given field, fill that from
the corresponding value from a previous record, if any.
By default, a 'missing' field either is absent, or has the empty-string value.
With -a, a field is 'missing' only if it is absent.

Options:
 --all Operate on all fields in the input.
 -a|--only-if-absent If a given record has a missing value for a given field,
     fill that from the corresponding value from a previous record, if any.
     By default, a 'missing' field either is absent, or has the empty-string value.
     With -a, a field is 'missing' only if it is absent.
 -f  Field names for fill-down.
 -h|--help Show this message.

================================================================
Usage: mlr fill-empty [options]
Fills empty-string fields with specified fill-value.
Options:
-v {string} Fill-value: defaults to "N/A"

================================================================
Usage: mlr filter [options] {DSL expression}
Options:
-f {file name} File containing a DSL expression. If the filename is a directory,
   all *.mlr files in that directory are loaded.

-e {expression} You can use this after -f to add an expression. Example use
   case: define functions/subroutines in a file you specify with -f, then call
   them with an expression you specify with -e.

(If you mix -e and -f then the expressions are evaluated in the order encountered.
Since the expression pieces are simply concatenated, please be sure to use intervening
semicolons to separate expressions.)

-s name=value: Predefines out-of-stream variable @name to have 
    Thus mlr put -s foo=97 '$column += @foo' is like
    mlr put 'begin {@foo = 97} $column += @foo'.
    The value part is subject to type-inferencing.
    May be specified more than once, e.g. -s name1=value1 -s name2=value2.
    Note: the value may be an environment variable, e.g. -s sequence=$SEQUENCE

-x (default false) Prints records for which {expression} evaluates to false, not true,
   i.e. invert the sense of the filter expression.

-q Does not include the modified record in the output stream.
   Useful for when all desired output is in begin and/or end blocks.

-S and -F: There are no-ops in Miller 6 and above, since now type-inferencing is done
   by the record-readers before filter/put is executed. Supported as no-op pass-through
   flags for backward compatibility.

-h|--help Show this message.

Parser-info options:

-w Print warnings about things like uninitialized variables.

-W Same as -w, but exit the process if there are any warnings.

-p Prints the expressions's AST (abstract syntax tree), which gives full
  transparency on the precedence and associativity rules of Miller's grammar,
  to stdout.

-d Like -p but uses a parenthesized-expression format for the AST.

-D Like -d but with output all on one line.

-E Echo DSL expression before printing parse-tree

-v Same as -E -p.

-X Exit after parsing but before stream-processing. Useful with -v/-d/-D, if you
   only want to look at parser information.

================================================================
Usage: mlr flatten [options]
Flattens multi-level maps to single-level ones. Example: field with name 'a'
and value '{"b": { "c": 4 }}' becomes name 'a.b.c' and value 4.
Options:
-f Comma-separated list of field names to flatten (default all).
-s Separator, defaulting to mlr --flatsep value.
-h|--help Show this message.

================================================================
Usage: mlr format-values [options]
Applies format strings to all field values, depending on autodetected type.
* If a field value is detected to be integer, applies integer format.
* Else, if a field value is detected to be float, applies float format.
* Else, applies string format.

Note: this is a low-keystroke way to apply formatting to many fields. To get
finer control, please see the fmtnum function within the mlr put DSL.

Note: this verb lets you apply arbitrary format strings, which can produce
undefined behavior and/or program crashes.  See your system's "man printf".

Options:
-i {integer format} Defaults to "%d".
                    Examples: "%06lld", "%08llx".
                    Note that Miller integers are long long so you must use
                    formats which apply to long long, e.g. with ll in them.
                    Undefined behavior results otherwise.
-f {float format}   Defaults to "%f".
                    Examples: "%8.3lf", "%.6le".
                    Note that Miller floats are double-precision so you must
                    use formats which apply to double, e.g. with l[efg] in them.
                    Undefined behavior results otherwise.
-s {string format}  Defaults to "%s".
                    Examples: "_%s", "%08s".
                    Note that you must use formats which apply to string, e.g.
                    with s in them. Undefined behavior results otherwise.
-n                  Coerce field values autodetected as int to float, and then
                    apply the float format.

================================================================
Usage: mlr fraction [options]
For each record's value in specified fields, computes the ratio of that
value to the sum of values in that field over all input records.
E.g. with input records  x=1  x=2  x=3  and  x=4, emits output records
x=1,x_fraction=0.1  x=2,x_fraction=0.2  x=3,x_fraction=0.3  and  x=4,x_fraction=0.4

Note: this is internally a two-pass algorithm: on the first pass it retains
input records and accumulates sums; on the second pass it computes quotients
and emits output records. This means it produces no output until all input is read.

Options:
-f {a,b,c}    Field name(s) for fraction calculation
-g {d,e,f}    Optional group-by-field name(s) for fraction counts
-p            Produce percents [0..100], not fractions [0..1]. Output field names
              end with "_percent" rather than "_fraction"
-c            Produce cumulative distributions, i.e. running sums: each output
              value folds in the sum of the previous for the specified group
              E.g. with input records  x=1  x=2  x=3  and  x=4, emits output records
              x=1,x_cumulative_fraction=0.1  x=2,x_cumulative_fraction=0.3
              x=3,x_cumulative_fraction=0.6  and  x=4,x_cumulative_fraction=1.0

================================================================
Usage: mlr gap [options]
Emits an empty record every n records, or when certain values change.
Options:
Emits an empty record every n records, or when certain values change.
-g {a,b,c} Print a gap whenever values of these fields (e.g. a,b,c) changes.
-n {n} Print a gap every n records.
One of -f or -g is required.
-n is ignored if -g is present.
-h|--help Show this message.

================================================================
Usage: mlr grep [options] {regular expression}
Passes through records which match the regular expression.
Options:
-i  Use case-insensitive search.
-v  Invert: pass through records which do not match the regex.
-h|--help Show this message.
Note that "mlr filter" is more powerful, but requires you to know field names.
By contrast, "mlr grep" allows you to regex-match the entire record. It does
this by formatting each record in memory as DKVP, using command-line-specified
ORS/OFS/OPS, and matching the resulting line against the regex specified
here. In particular, the regex is not applied to the input stream: if you
have CSV with header line "x,y,z" and data line "1,2,3" then the regex will
be matched, not against either of these lines, but against the DKVP line
"x=1,y=2,z=3".  Furthermore, not all the options to system grep are supported,
and this command is intended to be merely a keystroke-saver. To get all the
features of system grep, you can do
  "mlr --odkvp ... | grep ... | mlr --idkvp ..."

Usage: mlr head [options]
Passes through the first n records, optionally by category.
Options:
-g {a,b,c} Optional group-by-field names for head counts, e.g. a,b,c.
-n {n} Head-count to print. Default 10.

--lo {lo}     Histogram low value
--hi {hi}     Histogram high value
--nbins {n}   Number of histogram bins
--auto        Automatically computes limits, ignoring --lo and --hi.

================================================================
Usage: mlr join [options]
Joins records from specified left file name with records from all file names
at the end of the Miller argument list.
Functionality is essentially the same as the system "join" command, but for
record streams.
Options:
  -f {left file name}
  -j {a,b,c}   Comma-separated join-field names for output
  -l {a,b,c}   Comma-separated join-field names for left input file;
               defaults to -j values if omitted.
  -r {a,b,c}   Comma-separated join-field names for right input file(s);
               defaults to -j values if omitted.
  --lp {text}  Additional prefix for non-join output field names from
               the left file
  --rp {text}  Additional prefix for non-join output field names from
               the right file(s)
  --np         Do not emit paired records
  --ul         Emit unpaired records from the left file
  --ur         Emit unpaired records from the right file(s)
  -s|--sorted-input  Require sorted input: records must be sorted
               lexically by their join-field names, else not all records will
               be paired. The only likely use case for this is with a left
               file which is too big to fit into system memory otherwise.
  -u           Enable unsorted input. (This is the default even without -u.)
               In this case, the entire left file will be loaded into memory.
  --prepipe {command} As in main input options; see mlr --help for details.
               If you wish to use a prepipe command for the main input as well
               as here, it must be specified there as well as here.
  --prepipex {command} Likewise.
File-format options default to those for the right file names on the Miller
argument list, but may be overridden for the left file as follows. Please see
the main "mlr --help" for more information on syntax for these arguments:
  -i {one of csv,dkvp,nidx,pprint,xtab}
  --irs {record-separator character}
  --ifs {field-separator character}
  --ips {pair-separator character}
  --repifs
  --repips
  --implicit-csv-header
  --no-implicit-csv-header
For example, if you have 'mlr --csv ... join -l foo ... ' then the left-file format will
be specified CSV as well unless you override with 'mlr --csv ... join --ijson -l foo' etc.
Likewise, if you have 'mlr --csv --implicit-csv-header ...' then the join-in file will be
expected to be headerless as well unless you put '--no-implicit-csv-header' after 'join'.
Please use "mlr --usage-separator-options" for information on specifying separators.
Please see https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference-verbs.html#join for more information

Usage: mlr label [options] {new1,new2,new3,...}
Given n comma-separated names, renames the first n fields of each record to

================================================================
Usage: mlr least-frequent [options]
Shows the least frequently occurring distinct values for specified field names.
The first entry is the statistical anti-mode; the remaining are runners-up.
Options:
-f {one or more comma-separated field names}. Required flag.
-n {count}. Optional flag defaulting to 10.
-b          Suppress counts; show only field values.
-o {name}   Field name for output count. Default "count".
See also "mlr most-frequent".

================================================================
Usage: mlr merge-fields [options]
Computes univariate statistics for each input record, accumulated across
specified fields.
Options:
-a {sum,count,...}  Names of accumulators. One or more of:
  count    Count instances of fields
  mode     Find most-frequently-occurring values for fields; first-found wins tie
  antimode Find least-frequently-occurring values for fields; first-found wins tie
  sum      Compute sums of specified fields
  mean     Compute averages (sample means) of specified fields
  var      Compute sample variance of specified fields
  stddev   Compute sample standard deviation of specified fields
  meaneb   Estimate error bars for averages (assuming no sample autocorrelation)
  skewness Compute sample skewness of specified fields
  kurtosis Compute sample kurtosis of specified fields
  min      Compute minimum values of specified fields
  max      Compute maximum values of specified fields
-f {a,b,c}  Value-field names on which to compute statistics. Requires -o.
-r {a,b,c}  Regular expressions for value-field names on which to compute
            statistics. Requires -o.
-c {a,b,c}  Substrings for collapse mode. All fields which have the same names
            after removing substrings will be accumulated together. Please see
            examples below.
-i          Use interpolated percentiles, like R's type=7; default like type=1.
            Not sensical for string-valued fields.
-o {name}   Output field basename for -f/-r.
-k          Keep the input fields which contributed to the output statistics;
            the default is to omit them.

String-valued data make sense unless arithmetic on them is required,
e.g. for sum, mean, interpolated percentiles, etc. In case of mixed data,
numbers are less than strings.

Example input data: "a_in_x=1,a_out_x=2,b_in_y=4,b_out_x=8".
Example: mlr merge-fields -a sum,count -f a_in_x,a_out_x -o foo
  produces "b_in_y=4,b_out_x=8,foo_sum=3,foo_count=2" since "a_in_x,a_out_x" are
  summed over.
Example: mlr merge-fields -a sum,count -r in_,out_ -o bar
  produces "bar_sum=15,bar_count=4" since all four fields are summed over.
Example: mlr merge-fields -a sum,count -c in_,out_
  produces "a_x_sum=3,a_x_count=2,b_y_sum=4,b_y_count=1,b_x_sum=8,b_x_count=1"
  since "a_in_x" and "a_out_x" both collapse to "a_x", "b_in_y" collapses to
  "b_y", and "b_out_x" collapses to "b_x".

================================================================
Usage: mlr most-frequent [options]
Shows the most frequently occurring distinct values for specified field names.
The first entry is the statistical mode; the remaining are runners-up.
Options:
-f {one or more comma-separated field names}. Required flag.
-n {count}. Optional flag defaulting to 10.
-b          Suppress counts; show only field values.
-o {name}   Field name for output count. Default "count".
See also "mlr least-frequent".

================================================================
Usage: mlr nest [options]
Explodes specified field values into separate fields/records, or reverses this.
Options:
  --explode,--implode   One is required.
  --values,--pairs      One is required.
  --across-records,--across-fields One is required.
  -f {field name}       Required.
  --nested-fs {string}  Defaults to ";". Field separator for nested values.
  --nested-ps {string}  Defaults to ":". Pair separator for nested key-value pairs.
  --evar {string}       Shorthand for --explode --values ---across-records --nested-fs {string}
  --ivar {string}       Shorthand for --implode --values ---across-records --nested-fs {string}
Please use "mlr --usage-separator-options" for information on specifying separators.

Examples:

  mlr nest --explode --values --across-records -f x
  with input record "x=a;b;c,y=d" produces output records
    "x=a,y=d"
    "x=b,y=d"
    "x=c,y=d"
  Use --implode to do the reverse.

  mlr nest --explode --values --across-fields -f x
  with input record "x=a;b;c,y=d" produces output records
    "x_1=a,x_2=b,x_3=c,y=d"
  Use --implode to do the reverse.

  mlr nest --explode --pairs --across-records -f x
  with input record "x=a:1;b:2;c:3,y=d" produces output records
    "a=1,y=d"
    "b=2,y=d"
    "c=3,y=d"

  mlr nest --explode --pairs --across-fields -f x
  with input record "x=a:1;b:2;c:3,y=d" produces output records
    "a=1,b=2,c=3,y=d"

Notes:
* With --pairs, --implode doesn't make sense since the original field name has
  been lost.
* The combination "--implode --values --across-records" is non-streaming:
  no output records are produced until all input records have been read. In
  particular, this means it won't work in tail -f contexts. But all other flag
  combinations result in streaming (tail -f friendly) data processing.
* It's up to you to ensure that the nested-fs is distinct from your data's IFS:
  e.g. by default the former is semicolon and the latter is comma.

Since the expression pieces are simply concatenated, please be sure to use intervening
semicolons to separate expressions.)

-s name=value: Predefines out-of-stream variable @name to have 
    Thus mlr put -s foo=97 '$column += @foo' is like
    mlr put 'begin {@foo = 97} $column += @foo'.
    The value part is subject to type-inferencing.
    May be specified more than once, e.g. -s name1=value1 -s name2=value2.
    Note: the value may be an environment variable, e.g. -s sequence=$SEQUENCE

-x (default false) Prints records for which {expression} evaluates to false, not true,
   i.e. invert the sense of the filter expression.

-q Does not include the modified record in the output stream.
   Useful for when all desired output is in begin and/or end blocks.

-S and -F: There are no-ops in Miller 6 and above, since now type-inferencing is done
   by the record-readers before filter/put is executed. Supported as no-op pass-through
   flags for backward compatibility.

-h|--help Show this message.

Parser-info options:

-w Print warnings about things like uninitialized variables.

-W Same as -w, but exit the process if there are any warnings.

-p Prints the expressions's AST (abstract syntax tree), which gives full
  transparency on the precedence and associativity rules of Miller's grammar,
  to stdout.

-d Like -p but uses a parenthesized-expression format for the AST.

-D Like -d but with output all on one line.

-E Echo DSL expression before printing parse-tree

-v Same as -E -p.

-X Exit after parsing but before stream-processing. Useful with -v/-d/-D, if you
   only want to look at parser information.

================================================================
Usage: mlr rename [options] {old1,new1,old2,new2,...}
Renames specified fields.
Options:
-r         Treat old field  names as regular expressions. "ab", "a.*b"
           will match any field name containing the substring "ab" or
           matching "a.*b", respectively; anchors of the form "^ab$",
           "^a.*b$" may be used. New field names may be plain strings,
           or may contain capture groups of the form "\1" through
           "\9". Wrapping the regex in double quotes is optional, but
           is required if you wish to follow it with 'i' to indicate
           case-insensitivity.
-g         Do global replacement within each field name rather than
           first-match replacement.
-h|--help Show this message.
Examples:
mlr rename old_name,new_name'
mlr rename old_name_1,new_name_1,old_name_2,new_name_2'
mlr rename -r 'Date_[0-9]+,Date,'  Rename all such fields to be "Date"
mlr rename -r '"Date_[0-9]+",Date' Same
mlr rename -r 'Date_([0-9]+).*,\1' Rename all such fields to be of the form 20151015
mlr rename -r '"name"i,Name'       Rename "name", "Name", "NAME", etc. to "Name"

================================================================
Usage: mlr reorder [options]
Moves specified names to start of record, or end of record.
Options:
-e Put specified field names at record end: default is to put them at record start.
-f {a,b,c} Field names to reorder.
-b {x}     Put field names specified with -f before field name specified by {x},
           if any. If {x} isn't present in a given record, the specified fields
           will not be moved.
-a {x}     Put field names specified with -f after field name specified by {x},
           if any. If {x} isn't present in a given record, the specified fields
           will not be moved.
-h|--help Show this message.

Examples:
mlr reorder    -f a,b sends input record "d=4,b=2,a=1,c=3" to "a=1,b=2,d=4,c=3".
mlr reorder -e -f a,b sends input record "d=4,b=2,a=1,c=3" to "d=4,c=3,a=1,b=2".

================================================================
Usage: mlr repeat [options]
Copies input records to output records multiple times.
Options must be exactly one of the following:
-n {repeat count}  Repeat each input record this many times.
-f {field name}    Same, but take the repeat count from the specified
                   field name of each input record.
-h|--help Show this message.
Example:
  echo x=0 | mlr repeat -n 4 then put '$x=urand()'
produces:
 x=0.488189
 x=0.484973
 x=0.704983
 x=0.147311
Example:
  echo a=1,b=2,c=3 | mlr repeat -f b
produces:
  a=1,b=2,c=3
  a=1,b=2,c=3
Example:
  echo a=1,b=2,c=3 | mlr repeat -f c
produces:
  a=1,b=2,c=3
  a=1,b=2,c=3
  a=1,b=2,c=3

================================================================
Usage: mlr reshape [options]
Wide-to-long options:
  -i {input field names}   -o {key-field name,value-field name}
  -r {input field regexes} -o {key-field name,value-field name}
  These pivot/reshape the input data such that the input fields are removed
  and separate records are emitted for each key/value pair.
  Note: this works with tail -f and produces output records for each input
  record seen.
Long-to-wide options:
  -s {key-field name,value-field name}
  These pivot/reshape the input data to undo the wide-to-long operation.
  Note: this does not work with tail -f; it produces output records only after
  all input records have been read.

Examples:

Usage: ../c/mlr sec2gmtdate {comma-separated list of field names}
Replaces a numeric field representing seconds since the epoch with the
corresponding GMT year-month-day timestamp; leaves non-numbers as-is.
This is nothing more than a keystroke-saver for the sec2gmtdate function:
  ../c/mlr sec2gmtdate time1,time2
is the same as
  ../c/mlr put '$time1=sec2gmtdate($time1);$time2=sec2gmtdate($time2)'

Options:
-1 through -9: format the seconds using 1..9 decimal places, respectively.
--millis Input numbers are treated as milliseconds since the epoch.
--micros Input numbers are treated as microseconds since the epoch.
--nanos  Input numbers are treated as nanoseconds since the epoch.

Usage: mlr sort {flags}
Sorts records primarily by the first specified field, secondarily by the second
field, and so on.  (Any records not having all specified sort keys will appear
at the end of the output, in the order they were encountered, regardless of the
specified sort order.) The sort is stable: records that compare equal will sort
in the order they were encountered in the input record stream.

Options:
-f  {comma-separated field names}  Lexical ascending
-n  {comma-separated field names}  Numerical ascending; nulls sort last
-nf {comma-separated field names}  Same as -n
-r  {comma-separated field names}  Lexical descending
-nr {comma-separated field names}  Numerical descending; nulls sort first

Usage: mlr stats1 [options]
Computes univariate statistics for one or more given fields, accumulated across
the input record stream.
Options:
-a {sum,count,...} Names of accumulators: one or more of:
  median   This is the same as p50
  p10 p25.2 p50 p98 p100 etc.
  TODO: flags for interpolated percentiles
  count    Count instances of fields
  mode     Find most-frequently-occurring values for fields; first-found wins tie
  antimode Find least-frequently-occurring values for fields; first-found wins tie
  sum      Compute sums of specified fields
  mean     Compute averages (sample means) of specified fields
  var      Compute sample variance of specified fields
  stddev   Compute sample standard deviation of specified fields
  meaneb   Estimate error bars for averages (assuming no sample autocorrelation)
  skewness Compute sample skewness of specified fields
  kurtosis Compute sample kurtosis of specified fields
  min      Compute minimum values of specified fields
  max      Compute maximum values of specified fields

-f {a,b,c}   Value-field names on which to compute statistics
-g {d,e,f}   Optional group-by-field names

-i           Use interpolated percentiles, like R's type=7; default like type=1.\n");
             Not sensical for string-valued fields.\n");
-s           Print iterative stats. Useful in tail -f contexts (in which
             case please avoid pprint-format output since end of input
             stream will never be seen).

 mlr stats1
Example: mlr stats1 -a count,mode -f size -g shape
 mlr stats1
Example: mlr stats1 -a count,mode --fr '^[a-h].*$' -gr '^k.*$'
 mlr stats1
        This computes count and mode statistics on all field names beginning
         with a through h, grouped by all field names starting with k.

Notes:
* p50 and median are synonymous.
* min and max output the same results as p0 and p100, respectively, but use
  less memory.
* String-valued data make sense unless arithmetic on them is required,
  e.g. for sum, mean, interpolated percentiles, etc. In case of mixed data,
  numbers are less than strings.
* count and mode allow text input; the rest require numeric input.
  In particular, 1 and 1.0 are distinct text for count and mode.
* When there are mode ties, the first-encountered datum wins.

================================================================
Usage: mlr stats2 [options]
Computes bivariate statistics for one or more given field-name pairs,
accumulated across the input record stream.
-a {linreg-ols,corr,...}  Names of accumulators: one or more of:
  linreg-ols Linear regression using ordinary least squares
  linreg-pca Linear regression using principal component analysis
  r2       Quality metric for linreg-ols (linreg-pca emits its own)
  logireg  Logistic regression
  corr     Sample correlation
  cov      Sample covariance
  covx     Sample-covariance matrix
-f {a,b,c,d}   Value-field name-pairs on which to compute statistics.
               There must be an even number of names.
-g {e,f,g}     Optional group-by-field names.
-v             Print additional output for linreg-pca.
-s             Print iterative stats. Useful in tail -f contexts (in which
               case please avoid pprint-format output since end of input
               stream will never be seen).
--fit          Rather than printing regression parameters, applies them to
               the input data to compute new fit fields. All input records are
               held in memory until end of input stream. Has effect only for
               linreg-ols, linreg-pca, and logireg.
Only one of -s or --fit may be used.
Example: mlr stats2 -a linreg-pca -f x,y
Example: mlr stats2 -a linreg-ols,r2 -f x,y -g size,shape
Example: mlr stats2 -a corr -f x,y

-g {d,e,f} Optional group-by-field names
-F         Computes integerable things (e.g. counter) in floating point.
           As of Miller 6 this happens automatically, but the flag is accepted
           as a no-op for backward compatibility with Miller 5 and below.
-d {x,y,z} Weights for ewma. 1 means current sample gets all weight (no
           smoothing), near under under 1 is light smoothing, near over 0 is
           heavy smoothing. Multiple weights may be specified, e.g.
           "mlr step -a ewma -f sys_load -d 0.01,0.1,0.9". Default if omitted
           is "-d 0.5".
-o {a,b,c} Custom suffixes for EWMA output fields. If omitted, these default to
           the -d values. If supplied, the number of -o values must be the same

-n {count}    How many records to print per category; default 1.
-a            Print all fields for top-value records; default is
              to print only value and group-by fields. Requires a single
              value-field name only.
--min         Print top smallest values; default is top largest values.
-F            Keep top values as floats even if they look like integers.

              With neither -c nor -n, produces unique records.

================================================================
Usage: mlr unsparsify [options]
Prints records with the union of field names over all input records.
For field names absent in a given record but present in others, fills in
a value. This verb retains all input before producing any output.
Options:
--fill-with {filler string}  What to fill absent fields with. Defaults to
                             the empty string.
