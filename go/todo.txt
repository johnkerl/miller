    - distcheck: gtar --transform 's,^./,miller-6.0.0/,' --exclude ./.git -czf /tmp/miller-6.0.0.tgz .
      > also exclude: data, docs, experiments, per, python, vim
      > on macos, 'brew install gnu-tar' will install 'gtar'
  o blockers:
    - fractional-strptime
    - cmp-matrices
    - all-contribs
    - license triple-checks
    ? alpha?
    - csv irs lf/crlf ignores -- ? already is so?
    - `mlr put` -> coverart
    - 0b1011 olh/webdoc

  o doc / release:
    - ? auto-cp go/mlr // go/mlr.exe to basedir?
    - auto-path (../go/mlr) in docs dir ...
    - brew as first trial -- ?
      > brew macports chocolatey
        ubuntu debian fedora gentoo prolinux archlinux
        netbsd freebsd

* post-release:
  w installing-miller.md.in
  w build.md.in developer/release notes
  ? RTD -> GP -- ?

? twi-dm re all-contribs: all-contributors.org
* nikos materials -> fold in

* cases/dsl-min-max-types: cmp-matrices need to be fixed to follow the advertised rule for mixed types
  NUMERICS < BOOL < VOID < STRING

* regex
  o authoritative regex docs accompanied by thorough UT
    - expand existing regex webdoc
  o r-strings/implicit-r/297: double-check end of reference-main-data-types.md.in
  o reference-main-regular-expressions:
    separate escaping for "\t" etc in arg-2/regex position -- "\t"."\t" example as well ...

* datetime
  o sysdate, sysdate_local; datediff ...
  o .6S bugfix -- separate PR -- ?
  o strptime w/ ...00.Z -> error
  o strptime/strftime experiments ...
    - verb sec2gmtdate
      > leaves non-numbers as-is -- ?
      > check sec2gmt as well -- ?
    ! strptime:
      strptime("1970-01-01T00:00:00.Z", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
      (error)

* olh
  o kw olh for func and funct both
  o better help-searching:
    ? mlr help search foo -- including flag-search
    ? mlr -f foo
    ? mlr -F foo == mlr help function foo

* pre-release:
  o draft release w/ m6 binaries YYYYMMDD -- ?
  o gha download steps clearer
  o doc6
  o check issues
  o TODO in *.go & *.mi
  o release notes per se

    - emittable constraints -- ?
  o wut h1 spacing before/after ...
  o document re auto in nim6.in
  o shell-commands: while-read example from issues
  ? special-symbols-and-formatting: How to escape '?' in regexes? -> still true? link to torbiak297?
  E reference-dsl-user-defined-functions: UDSes -> non-factorial example -- maybe some useful aggregator
  o reference-main-arithmetic: ? test stats1/step -F flag
  o reference-dsl-control-structures:
    e while (NR < 10) will never terminate as NR is only incremented between
      records -> and each expression is invoked once per record so once for NR=1,
      once for NR=2, etc.
  o C-style triple-for loops: loop to NR -> NO!!!
  o Since uninitialized out-of-stream variables default to 0 for
    addition/substraction and 1 for multiplication when they appear on expression
    right-hand sides (not quite as in awk, where they'd default to 0 either way)
    <-> xlink to other page
  r fzf-ish w/ head -n 4, --from, up-arrow & append verb, then cat -- find & update the existing section
  ! https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/653 -- stats1 w/ empties? check stats2
    - needs UTs as well
  o while-read example from issues

* pv: 'mlr --prepipex pv --gzin tail -n 10 ~/tmp/zhuge.gz' needs --gzin & --prepipex both
  o plus corresponding docwork

? BIFs as FCFs?

================================================================
MAYBES

* dotted-syntax support in verbs?

* repl as verb -- ?  'put --repl' maybe

* json-triple-quote -- what can be done here?

* non-blocker: _ variable feature?

* headerful/headerless mix -- ?
  TOptions as list, not single -- ?

* miller extensibility re golang plugins -- ?!?
  ? verbs ?
  ? DSL functions ?

* pkg graph:
  go get github.com/kisielk/godepgraph
  godepgraph miller | dot -Tpng -o ~/Desktop/mlrdeps.png
  flamegraph etc double-check

* more data formats:
  https://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/contributions/2585787/attachments/1463230/2260889/pivarski-data-formats.pdf

----------------------------------------------------------------
DEFER:
* parser-fu:
  o iterative LALR grok
- jackson notes
- gocc .txt/.go for simple grammars
o find/bookmark/grok rob's lexer slides
o iterate on a parser-generator with JSON config file
no need to bootstrap a parser for the parser-generator language

----------------------------------------------------------------
INFO

i go tool nm -size mlr | sort -nrk 2

----------------------------------------------------------------
GOCC UPSTREAMS:

? support "abc" (not just 'a' 'b' 'c') in the lexer part

----------------------------------------------------------------
TBF:
* go 1.16 at some point
* tools/perf:
  o https://eng.uber.com/pprof-go-profiler/
  o profile mlr --j2x cat mappings.json
  o golang static-analysis tool -- ?
* iconv note
* AST insertions: make a simple NodeFromToken & have all interface{} be *ASTNode, not *token.Token
* cst printer with reflect.TypeOf -- ?
? makefile for build-dsl: if $bnf newer than productionstable.go
* I/O perf delta between C & Go is smaller for CSV, middle for DKVP, large for JSON -- debug
* neaten/error-proof:
  o mlrmapEntry -> own keys/mlrvals -- keep the kcopy/vcopy & be very clear,
    or remove. (keeping pointers allows nil-check which is good.)
  o inrec *types.Mlrmap is good for default no-copy across channels ... needs
    a big red flag though for things like the repeat verb (maybe *only* that one ...)
! clean up the AST API. ish! :^/
* json:
  d thorough UT for json mlrval-parser including various expect-fail error cases
  d doc re no jlistwrap on input if they want get streaming input
  d UT JSON-to-JSON cat-mapping should be identical
  d JSON-like accessor syntax in the grammar: $field[3]["bar"]
  d flatten/unflatten for non-JSON I/O formats -- maybe just double-quoted JSON strings -- ?
    - make a force-single-line writer
    - make a jsonparse DSL function -- ?
  d other formats: use JSON marshaler for collection types, maybe double-quoted
  o research gocc support
  o maybe a case for hand-roll
? dsl/ast.go -> parsing/ast.go? then, put new-ast ctor -> parsing package
  o if so, update r.mds
* relnotes: label b,i,x vs x,i,b change
* double-check dump CR-terminators depending on expression type
* good example of wording for why/when to make a breaking release:
  https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/
* unset, unassign, remove -- too many different names. also assign/put ... maybe stick w/ 2?
* huge commenting pass
* profile mlr sort
* go exe 17MB, wut. try to discover. (gocc presumably but verify.)
* fill-down make columns required. also, --all.
* check triple-dash at mlr fill-down-h ; check others
* clean up unused exitCode arg in sort/put usage.
  o also document pre/post conditions for flag and non-flag usages x all mappers
? emit @x or emit x -- should make k/v pairs w/ "x" & value -- ? check against C impl
i emitp/emitf -- note for-loops didn't appear until 4.1.0 & emits are much older (emitp 3.5.0).
  if i were starting clean-slate, i'd have had just a single `emit`.
* asserting_{type}: os.Exit(1) -> return nil, err flow?
* test put/filter w/ various combinations of -s/-e/-f
* mt_void keep-or-not .......
  o check dispo matrices
  o if keep, need careful MT_VOID at from-string constructor -- ? or not ?
  o comment clearly regardless
* bitwise_and_dispositions et al should not have _absn for collections -- _erro instead
* ast-parex separate mlr auxents entrypoint?
* port u/window*.mlr from mlrc to mlrgo (actually, fix mlrgo of course)
* line/column caret at parse-error messages -- would require some GOCC refactoring
  in order to get the full DSL string and the line/number info into the same method
* csvlite rd/wr: comment for USV/ASV too. no need for escaping then.
* comment schema-change supported only in csvlite reader, not csv reader
* for-multi: C semantics 'k1: data k2: a:x v:1', sigh ...
* neaten mlr gap -g (default) print
! write out thorough min/max/cmp cases for all orderings by type
* silent zero-pass for-loops on non-collections:
  o intended as a heterogenity feature ...
  o consider a --errors or --strict mode; something
* note about non-determinism for DSL print/dump vs record output-stream now ...
* put/filter updates:
* [[...]] / [[[...]]]:
  o put '$array = [1,2,3,[4,5]]' is a syntax error unfortunately; need '$array = [1,2,3,[4,5] ]'
i https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Delimiter_collision
* reorder locations of get/put/remove methods in mlrval/mlrmap
* grep out all error message from regtest outputs & doc them all & make sure index-searchable at readthedocs
* short 'asserting' functions (absent/error); and/or put --strict or somesuch
* function metadata: auto-sort on mlr -f?
* --x2b @ help-doc .go; etc
? remove flagSet x all -- ? for consistency?
* os.Args[0] etc -> "mlr" throughout the codebase
* emitx later: 'emit([a,b,c],d,e,f)' for SR-conflict issues

* genmds multi-line something something for autogen of repl examples -- ?

* maybe split Context into varying & non-varying -- separate structs entirely

* idea: records as mlrmap -> mlrval?
  o reduce $* copy ...
  o opens the door to some (verb-subset) truly arbitrary-JSON processing ...

* mlr --opprint put $[[1]] = $[[2]]; unset $["a"] ./regtest/input/abixy
  o squint at pointer-handling
  o output varied after flatten-mods

* join
  > clean up VERBOSE in joiner-files
  > joinBucketKeeper & joinBucket need to be privatized
  > rewrite join-bucket-keeper.go entirely
  > also needs UT per se (not just regression)
* cli-doc --no-auto-flatten and --no-auto-unflatten
* note (fix? doc?) flatten of '$x={}' expands to nothing. not invertible.
* parex print regtest -- what about new ast-node types?
* all case-files could use top-notes
* dev-note on why `int` not `int64` -- processor-arch & those who most need it get it
* doc auto-flatten/auto-unflatten -- incl narrative from mlrcli_parse.go
* doc6: default flatsep is now "." not ":" in keeping with JSON culture
? allow [[...]] / [[[...]]] at assignment LHS

* readeropts/writeropts/readerwriteropts -> cliutil funcs
  o then put into join.go, put.go, & repl
* mlr inp parse error failstring retback?
* https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors
* split REPL lines on ';' -- ?
* tilde-expand for REPL load/open: if '~' is at the start of the string, run it though 'sh -c echo'
* doc shift/unshift as using [2:] and append
? ctx invars -> ptr w/ cmt
? string/array slices on assignment LHS -- ?
* beyond:
  o support 'x[1]["a"]' etc notation in various verbs?
  o sort within nested data structures?
  o array-sort, map-key sort, map-value sort in the DSL?
  o closures for sorting and more -- ?!?
  o or maybe just use UDFs ...
* optimize MlrvalLessThanForSort
  o mlr --cpuprofile cpu.pprof --from ~tmp/big sort -f a -nr x then nothing
  o GOGC=1000 mlr --cpuprofile cpu.pprof --from /Users/kerl/tmp/huge sort -f a -nr x then nothing
  o wc -l ~/tmp/big
    1000000 /Users/kerl/tmp/big
  o wc -l ~/tmp/huge
    10000000 /Users/kerl/tmp/huge
* optimize MlrvalGetMeanEB et al.
* data-copy reduction wup:
  o literal-type nodes -- now zero-copy
  x modify Evaluate to return pointer -- too much copying
  o wup for it was the binary-operator node, w/ the '*', that broke w/ no-output-copy & fibo UT
  o bonus: return MlrvalSqrt(MlrvalDivide(input1, input2))
  o type-gated mv -- should use passed-in storage slot -- ?
  o nice narrative write-up w/ the C stack-allocator problem, Go non-solution,
    profilng methods, GC readings/findings, before-and-after CST data structures,
    final perf results.
  o next round of data-copy reduction:
    - $z = min($x, $y) -- needs to return pointer to x or y
    o $z = $x + $y -- needs to have space for sum, and return pointer to it
    o therefore type BinaryFunc func(input1, input2 *Mlrval) *types.Mlrval
      > have the function z-allocate outputs when needed
      > the outputs must be on the stack, not statically allocated, to make them re-entrant
        and OK for recursive functions
      > var output types.Mlrval w/ field-setters, rather than return &Mlrval{... all of them ...}
    - then IEvaluable: Evaluate(state *runtime.State) *types.Mlrval
    - invalidate CopyFrom
    - check for under/over copy at Assign
    - global *ERROR / *ABSENT / etc
* for i, e in range c optimization -- always *copies* e
  o try and benchmark/compare ...
  o lots of array-of-pointer stuff, this is totally fine
  o take care w/ copying (non-pointer) mlrvals though
* more copy-on-retain for concurrent pointer-mods
  o make a thorough audit, and warn everywhere
  o either do copy for all retainers, or treat inrecs as immutable ...
  o 'this.recordsAndContexts.PushBack(inrecAndContext)' idiom needs copy everywhere ...
* consider -w/-W to stderr not stdout -- ?
* doc6 re warnings
* -W to mlr main also -- so it can be used with .mlrrc
* push/pop/shift/unshift functions
* 0035.cmd
  begin{@x=1} func f(x) { dump; print "hello"; tee  > ENV["outdir"]."/udf-x", $* } $o=f($i)

* zlib: n.b. brew install pigz, then pigz -z

* regex-capture follow-on: https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/388 is much cleaner
  o keep current syntax for backward compatibility
  o but encourage use of this

* put -T -- ?

----------------------------------------------------------------
DOC6:

* mlrdoc false && 4, true || 4 because of short-circuiting requirement
* error if UDF has same name as built-in
* more text examples in mlr-put doc
* window.mlr, window2.mlr -> doc somewhere
* doc: substr in inferred-numeric fields: https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/290.
  o xref to 1-up note.
* document --jvstack is now the default; --no-jvstack
* doc about put -S/-F cannot make sense anymore
* why not flagSet. can't be supported everywhere, so don't confuse the user by
  supporting it some places and not others.
* back-incompat:
  mlr -n put $vflag '@x=1; dump > stdout, @x'
  mlr -n put $vflag '@x=1; dump > stdout @x'

* document tee -p

* why no flagSet:

	Unlike other transformers, we can't use flagSet here. The syntax of 'mlr
	sort' is it needs to take things like 'mlr sort -f a -n b -n c', i.e.
	first sort lexically on field a, then numerically on field b, then
	lexically on field c. The flagSet API would let the '-f c' clobber the
	'-f a', while we want both.

	Unlike other transformers, we can't use flagSet here. The syntax of 'mlr put'
	and 'mlr filter' is they need to be able to take -f and/or -e more than
	once, and Go flags can't handle that.

* doc re multi-load: can't '$x >' and '3' in separate -f anymore. no worries.
* sec2gmt --millis/--micros/--nanos doc
* sort-within-records --recursive doc

* docs nest simplers now that we have getoptish
* mongo examples to doc :D
* doclink re https://readthedocs.org/projects/miller/ & https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/settings/hooks
* dotted-map doc ...
  o $*.foo["bar"] = NR b04k b/c precedence :(
  o change precedence?

? * would LOVE to have small prev-page/next-page links at the *top* not bottom ...
