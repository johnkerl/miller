* note somewhere (maybe 'what's new in miller6' and/or to-be-written survey review):
  o miller was first of all a tool for myself, and anyone else who might find it useful
  o since then it's been driven by feature requests -- people have great ideas and they get built
  o a key finding of the survey, though -- as well as various social-media references to miller --
    is "deserves to be better-known", "how have I not heard of this tool?", etc.
    So for Miller6, while several new features and improvements have been added
    by request at the code level, an equally strong effort has been put into
    human factors such as usability, improved documentation, improved on-line
    help, lower barrier to entry for developers, etc.

  mlr --icsv --implicit-csv-header --ifs space --oxtab --from elb-log put -q 'print $27'
* PR-template etc checklists

* clean up TODO/xxx in src/platform
* mlr regtest doc -- focus on either go/regtest or go/src/auxents/regtest, one linking to the other

* comment-handling
  - delegator for CSV ...

! quoted NIDX
  - how with whitespace regex -- ?
! quoted DKVP
  - what about csvlite-style -- ? needs a --dkvplite ?
! pprint emit on schema change, not all-at-end.

* widen DSL coverage
  o err-return for array/map get/put if incorrect types ... currently go-void ...
    ! the DSL needs a full, written-down-and-published spell-out of error-eval semantics
  o profile mand.mlr & check for need for idx-assign
    -> most definitely needed
  o multiple-valued return/assign -- ?
    - array destructure at LHS for multi-retval assign (maps too?)

* UT per se for lrec ops

* "Miller: " prefixes on all errors.New
* libify errors.New callsites for DSL/CST
* record-readers are fully in-channel/loop; record-writers are multi with in-channel/loop being
  done by ChannelWriter, which is very small. opportunity to refactor.
* address all manner of xxx and TODO comments
* empty csv ... reminder ...

================================================================
MAYBES

* dotted-syntax support in verbs?

* repl as verb -- ?  'put --repl' maybe

* json-triple-quote -- what can be done here?

? windows ./mlr hack

* non-blocker: _ variable feature?

* headerful/headerless mix -- ?
  TOptions as list, not single -- ?

* miller extensibility re golang plugins -- ?!?
  ? verbs ?
  ? DSL functions ?

* het ifmt-reading
  - separate out InputFormat into per-file (or tbd) & have autodetect on file endings -- ?
  - maybe a TBD reader -- ?
  - InputFormat into Context
  - TBD writer -- defer factory until first context?
  - deeper refactor pulling format out of reader/writer options entirely -- ?

* pkg graph:
  go get github.com/kisielk/godepgraph
  godepgraph miller | dot -Tpng -o ~/Desktop/mlrdeps.png
  flamegraph etc double-check

* more data formats:
  https://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/contributions/2585787/attachments/1463230/2260889/pivarski-data-formats.pdf

----------------------------------------------------------------
DEFER:
* parser-fu:
  o iterative LALR grok
- jackson notes
- gocc .txt/.go for simple grammars
o find/bookmark/grok rob's lexer slides
o iterate on a parser-generator with JSON config file
no need to bootstrap a parser for the parser-generator language

----------------------------------------------------------------
GOCC UPSTREAMS:

? support "abc" (not just 'a' 'b' 'c') in the lexer part

----------------------------------------------------------------
TBF:
* go 1.16 at some point
* tools/perf:
  o https://eng.uber.com/pprof-go-profiler/
  o profile mlr --j2x cat mappings.json
  o golang static-analysis tool -- ?
* iconv note
* AST insertions: make a simple NodeFromToken & have all interface{} be *ASTNode, not *token.Token
* cst printer with reflect.TypeOf -- ?
? makefile for build-dsl: if $bnf newer than productionstable.go
* I/O perf delta between C & Go is smaller for CSV, middle for DKVP, large for JSON -- debug
* neaten/error-proof:
  o mlrmapEntry -> own keys/mlrvals -- keep the kcopy/vcopy & be very clear,
    or remove. (keeping pointers allows nil-check which is good.)
  o inrec *types.Mlrmap is good for default no-copy across channels ... needs
    a big red flag though for things like the repeat verb (maybe *only* that one ...)
! clean up the AST API. ish! :^/
* json:
  d thorough UT for json mlrval-parser including various expect-fail error cases
  d doc re no jlistwrap on input if they want get streaming input
  d UT JSON-to-JSON cat-mapping should be identical
  d JSON-like accessor syntax in the grammar: $field[3]["bar"]
  d flatten/unflatten for non-JSON I/O formats -- maybe just double-quoted JSON strings -- ?
    - make a force-single-line writer
    - make a jsonparse DSL function -- ?
  d other formats: use JSON marshaler for collection types, maybe double-quoted
  o research gocc support
  o maybe a case for hand-roll
* ICE on scan of 0xffffffffffffffff
* support 0b0101 et al.? mlrdoc if so
? dsl/ast.go -> parsing/ast.go? then, put new-ast ctor -> parsing package
  o if so, update r.mds
* relnotes: label b,i,x vs x,i,b change
* double-check dump CR-terminators depending on expression type
* good example of wording for why/when to make a breaking release:
  https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/
* unset, unassign, remove -- too many different names. also assign/put ... maybe stick w/ 2?
* make truncate() UTF8-friendly
* huge commenting pass
* profile mlr sort
* go exe 17MB, wut. try to discover. (gocc presumably but verify.)
* fill-down make columns required. also, --all.
* check triple-dash at mlr fill-down-h ; check others
* clean up unused exitCode arg in sort/put usage.
  o also document pre/post conditions for flag and non-flag usages x all mappers
? emit @x or emit x -- should make k/v pairs w/ "x" & value -- ? check against C impl
i emitp/emitf -- note for-loops didn't appear until 4.1.0 & emits are much older (emitp 3.5.0).
  if i were starting clean-slate, i'd have had just a single `emit`.
* asserting_{type}: os.Exit(1) -> return nil, err flow?
* test put/filter w/ various combinations of -s/-e/-f
* mt_void keep-or-not .......
  o check dispo matrices
  o if keep, need careful MT_VOID at from-string constructor -- ? or not ?
  o comment clearly regardless
* bitwise_and_dispositions et al should not have _absn for collections -- _erro instead
* fmtnum: auto-replace %l_, %ll_ -> no l/ll for backwards compatibility, and comment accordingly
* ast-parex separate mlr auxents entrypoint?
* port u/window*.mlr from mlrc to mlrgo (actually, fix mlrgo of course)
* line/column caret at parse-error messages -- would require some GOCC refactoring
  in order to get the full DSL string and the line/number info into the same method
* csvlite rd/wr: comment for USV/ASV too. no need for escaping then.
* comment schema-change supported only in csvlite reader, not csv reader
* for-multi: C semantics 'k1: data k2: a:x v:1', sigh ...
* neaten mlr gap -g (default) print
! write out thorough min/max/cmp cases for all orderings by type
* silent zero-pass for-loops on non-collections:
  o intended as a heterogenity feature ...
  o consider a --errors or --strict mode; something
* note about non-determinism for DSL print/dump vs record output-stream now ...
* put/filter updates:
* [[...]] / [[[...]]]:
  o put '$array = [1,2,3,[4,5]]' is a syntax error unfortunately; need '$array = [1,2,3,[4,5] ]'
i https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Delimiter_collision
* substr(7,5) -- "" or error?
* reorder locations of get/put/remove methods in mlrval/mlrmap
* grep out all error message from regtest outputs & doc them all & make sure index-searchable at readthedocs
* short 'asserting' functions (absent/error); and/or put --strict or somesuch
* function metadata: auto-sort on mlr -f?
* --x2b @ help-doc .go; etc
? remove flagSet x all -- ? for consistency?
* os.Args[0] etc -> "mlr" throughout the codebase
* emitx later: 'emit([a,b,c],d,e,f)' for SR-conflict issues

* genmds multi-line something something for autogen of repl examples -- ?

* maybe split Context into varying & non-varying -- separate structs entirely

* idea: records as mlrmap -> mlrval?
  o reduce $* copy ...
  o opens the door to some (verb-subset) truly arbitrary-JSON processing ...

* mlr --opprint put $[[1]] = $[[2]]; unset $["a"] ./regtest/input/abixy
  o squint at pointer-handling
  o output varied after flatten-mods

* join
  > clean up VERBOSE in joiner-files
  > joinBucketKeeper & joinBucket need to be privatized
  > rewrite join-bucket-keeper.go entirely
  > also needs UT per se (not just regression)
* cli-doc --no-auto-flatten and --no-auto-unflatten
* note (fix? doc?) flatten of '$x={}' expands to nothing. not invertible.
* parex print regtest -- what about new ast-node types?
* all case-files could use top-notes
* dev-note on why `int` not `int64` -- processor-arch & those who most need it get it
* doc auto-flatten/auto-unflatten -- incl narrative from mlrcli_parse.go
* doc6: default flatsep is now "." not ":" in keeping with JSON culture
? allow [[...]] / [[[...]]] at assignment LHS

* readeropts/writeropts/readerwriteropts -> cliutil funcs
  o then put into join.go, put.go, & repl
* mlr inp parse error failstring retback?
* https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors
* split REPL lines on ';' -- ?
* tilde-expand for REPL load/open: if '~' is at the start of the string, run it though 'sh -c echo'
* doc shift/unshift as using [2:] and append
? ctx invars -> ptr w/ cmt
? string/array slices on assignment LHS -- ?
* beyond:
  o support 'x[1]["a"]' etc notation in various verbs?
  o sort within nested data structures?
  o array-sort, map-key sort, map-value sort in the DSL?
  o closures for sorting and more -- ?!?
  o or maybe just use UDFs ...
* optimize MlrvalLessThanForSort
  o mlr --cpuprofile cpu.pprof --from ~tmp/big sort -f a -nr x then nothing
  o GOGC=1000 mlr --cpuprofile cpu.pprof --from /Users/kerl/tmp/huge sort -f a -nr x then nothing
  o wc -l ~/tmp/big
    1000000 /Users/kerl/tmp/big
  o wc -l ~/tmp/huge
    10000000 /Users/kerl/tmp/huge
* optimize MlrvalGetMeanEB et al.
* data-copy reduction wup:
  o literal-type nodes -- now zero-copy
  x modify Evaluate to return pointer -- too much copying
  o wup for it was the binary-operator node, w/ the '*', that broke w/ no-output-copy & fibo UT
  o bonus: return MlrvalSqrt(MlrvalDivide(input1, input2))
  o type-gated mv -- should use passed-in storage slot -- ?
  o nice narrative write-up w/ the C stack-allocator problem, Go non-solution,
    profilng methods, GC readings/findings, before-and-after CST data structures,
    final perf results.
  o next round of data-copy reduction:
    - $z = min($x, $y) -- needs to return pointer to x or y
    o $z = $x + $y -- needs to have space for sum, and return pointer to it
    o therefore type BinaryFunc func(input1, input2 *Mlrval) *types.Mlrval
      > have the function z-allocate outputs when needed
      > the outputs must be on the stack, not statically allocated, to make them re-entrant
        and OK for recursive functions
      > var output types.Mlrval w/ field-setters, rather than return &Mlrval{... all of them ...}
    - then IEvaluable: Evaluate(state *runtime.State) *types.Mlrval
    - invalidate CopyFrom
    - check for under/over copy at Assign
    - global *ERROR / *ABSENT / etc
* for i, e in range c optimization -- always *copies* e
  o try and benchmark/compare ...
  o lots of array-of-pointer stuff, this is totally fine
  o take care w/ copying (non-pointer) mlrvals though
* more copy-on-retain for concurrent pointer-mods
  o make a thorough audit, and warn everywhere
  o either do copy for all retainers, or treat inrecs as immutable ...
  o 'this.recordsAndContexts.PushBack(inrecAndContext)' idiom needs copy everywhere ...
* consider -w/-W to stderr not stdout -- ?
* doc6 re warnings
* -W to mlr main also -- so it can be used with .mlrrc
* push/pop/shift/unshift functions
* 0035.cmd
  begin{@x=1} func f(x) { dump; print "hello"; tee  > ENV["outdir"]."/udf-x", $* } $o=f($i)

* zlib: n.b. brew install pigz, then pigz -z
* find a way to legitimize regtest/cases-non-windows for GHA
  - prepipe
  - system function

* regex-capture follow-on: https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/388 is much cleaner
  o keep current syntax for backward compatibility
  o but encourage use of this

* put -T -- ?

----------------------------------------------------------------
DOC6:

* mlrdoc false && 4, true || 4 because of short-circuiting requirement
* doc: no boolish truthy falsy
* mlrdoc: there should have always been a >>> and >>>=, and now there are
* error if UDF has same name as built-in
* more text examples in mlr-put doc
* window.mlr, window2.mlr -> doc somewhere
* mlrdoc for new go-only verbs
* doc: substr in inferred-numeric fields: https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/290.
  o xref to 1-up note.
* mlrdoc the ?? and ??? operators
* document --jvstack is now the default; --no-jvstack
* doc about put -S/-F cannot make sense anymore
* doc: string index/slice access on RHS
* why not flagSet. can't be supported everywhere, so don't confuse the user by
  supporting it some places and not others.
* doc: --jvquoteall --jknquoteint no-ops
* back-incompat:
  mlr -n put $vflag '@x=1; dump > stdout, @x'
  mlr -n put $vflag '@x=1; dump > stdout @x'

* doc-note: 'emit > stdout, @foo' and 'emit @foo' are not the same:
  o the former allows put --oxxx
  o the former is not necessarily in sync with the output record stream
* document tee -p

* why no flagSet:

	Unlike other transformers, we can't use flagSet here. The syntax of 'mlr
	sort' is it needs to take things like 'mlr sort -f a -n b -n c', i.e.
	first sort lexically on field a, then numerically on field b, then
	lexically on field c. The flagSet API would let the '-f c' clobber the
	'-f a', while we want both.

	Unlike other transformers, we can't use flagSet here. The syntax of 'mlr put'
	and 'mlr filter' is they need to be able to take -f and/or -e more than
	once, and Go flags can't handle that.

* doc re multi-load: can't '$x >' and '3' in separate -f anymore. no worries.
* doc re two-arg flatten
* sec2gmt --millis/--micros/--nanos doc
* sort-within-records --recursive doc
* doc re --load/--mload at mlrmain & repl
* doc re put -f dirname will load dirname/*.mlr
  mlr --opprint --from foo.dat --load u/stdlib/ put '$f=fibo($i); $g=factorial($i)'
  mlr --opprint --from foo.dat put -f u/stdlib/ -e '$f=fibo($i); $g=factorial($i)'

* docs nest simplers now that we have getoptish
* mongo examples to doc :D
* doclink re https://readthedocs.org/projects/miller/ & https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/settings/hooks
* dotted-map doc ...
  o $*.foo["bar"] = NR b04k b/c precedence :(
  o change precedence?

? * would LOVE to have small prev-page/next-page links at the *top* not bottom ...
