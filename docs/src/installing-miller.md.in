# Installing Miller

You can install Miller for various platforms as follows.

Download a binary:

* You can get binaries for several platforms on the [releases page](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/releases).
* You can get latest (head) builds for Linux, MacOS, and Windows by visiting [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/actions](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/actions), selecting the latest build, and clicking _Artifacts_. (These are retained for 5 days after each commit.)
* See also the [build page](build.md) if you prefer to build from source.

Using a package manager:

* Linux: `yum install miller` or `apt-get install miller` depending on your flavor of Linux, or [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/linux).
* MacOS: `brew update` and `brew install miller`, or `sudo port selfupdate` and `sudo port install miller`, depending on your preference of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://macports.org).
* Windows: `choco install miller` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org).
* Note: Miller 6 was released 2022-01-09; [several platforms](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/README-versions.md) may have Miller 5 available.

See also:

* [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/miller).
* [@jauderho](https://github.com/jauderho)'s [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/jauderho/miller/tags) as discussed in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/discussions/851#discussioncomment-1943255)
    * Example invocation: `docker run --rm -i jauderho/miller:latest --csv sort -f shape < ./example.csv`

Note that the [Miller releases page](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/releases), `brew`, `macports`, `chocolatey`, and `conda` tend to have current versions; `yum` and `apt-get` may have outdate versions depending on your platform.

As a first check, you should be able to run `mlr --version` at your system's command prompt and see something like the following:

GENMD-CARDIFY-HIGHLIGHT-ONE
mlr --version
mlr 6.0.0
GENMD-EOF

A note on documentation:

* If you downloaded the Miller binary from a tagged release, or installed it using a package manager, you should see a version like `mlr 6.0.0` or `mlr 5.10.3` -- please see the [release docs page](release-docs.md) to find the documentation for your version.
* If you installed from source or using a recent build artifact from GitHub Actions, you should see a version like `mlr 6.0.0-dev` -- [https://miller.readthedocs.io](https://miller.readthedocs.io) is the correct reference, since it contains information for the latest contributions to the [Miller repository](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller).

As a second check, given [example.csv](./example.csv) you should be able to do

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --csv cat example.csv
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --icsv --opprint cat example.csv
GENMD-EOF

If you run into issues on these checks, please check out the resources on the [community page](community.md) for help.

Otherwise, let's go on to [Miller in 10 minutes](10min.md)!
