As a first check, you should be able to run `mlr --version` at your system's command prompt and see something like the following:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --version
GENMD-EOF

If you Miller version is not 6 or above, please see the [release docs
page](release-docs.md) to find the documentation for your version.

As a second check, given [example.csv](./example.csv) you should be able to do

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --csv cat example.csv
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --icsv --opprint cat example.csv
GENMD-EOF

If you run into issues on these checks, please check out the resources on the [community page](community.md) for help.

Otherwise, let's go on to [Miller in 10 minutes](10min.md)!
