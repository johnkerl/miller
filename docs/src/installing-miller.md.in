# Installing Miller

You can install Miller for various platforms as follows.

* Miller 6 is in pre-release.
    * You can get latest Miller 6 builds for Linux, MacOS, and Windows by visiting [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/actions](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/actions), selecting the latest build, and clicking _Artifacts_. (These are retained for 5 days after each commit.)
    * See also the [build page](build.md) if you prefer -- in particular, if your platform's package manager doesn't have the latest release.
* Miller 5 is released.
    * Linux: `yum install miller` or `apt-get install miller` depending on your flavor of Linux, or [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/linux).
    * MacOS: `brew update` and `brew install miller`, or `sudo port selfupdate` and `sudo port install miller`, depending on your preference of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://macports.org).
    * Windows: `choco install miller` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org).

As a first check, you should be able to run `mlr --version` at your system's command prompt and see something like the following:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --version
GENMD-EOF

As a second check, given [example.csv](./example.csv) you should be able to do

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --csv cat example.csv
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --icsv --opprint cat example.csv
GENMD-EOF

If you run into issues on these checks, please check out the resources on the [community page](community.md) for help.

Otherwise, let's go on to [Miller in 10 minutes](10min.md)!
