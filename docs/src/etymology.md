# Why call it Miller?

The Unix toolkit was created in the **1970s** and is a mainstay to this day.  Miller's look and feel adheres closely to the [classic toolkit style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy): if this were music, Miller would be a **tribute album**. Likewise, since commands are subcommands of the `mlr` executable, the result is a **band**, if you will, of command-line tools. Put these together and the namesake is another classic product of the 1970s: the [Steve Miller Band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%5fMiller%5fBand).

(Additionally, and far more prosaically ... just as a miller is someone who grinds and mixes grain into flour to extend its usefulness, Miller grinds and mixes data for you.)
