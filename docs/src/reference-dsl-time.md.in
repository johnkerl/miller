# DSL datetime/timezone functions

Dates/times are not a separate data type; Miller uses ints for
[seconds since the epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) and strings for formatted
date/times. In this page we take a look at what some of the various options are
for processing datetimes and timezones in your data.

See also the [section on time-related
functions](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#time-functions) for
information auto-generated from Miller's online-help strings.

## Epoch seconds

[Seconds since the epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), or _Unix
Time_, is seconds (positive, zero, or negative) since midnight January 1 1970
UTC. This representation has several advantages, and is quite common in the
computing world.

Since this is a [number](reference-main-arithmetic.md) in Miller -- 64-bit
signed integer or double-precision floating-point -- it can represent dates
billions of years into the past or future without worry of overflow.  (There is
no [year-2038 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) here.)
Being numbers, epoch-seconds are easy to store in databases, communicate over
networks in binary format, etc.  Another benefit of epoch-seconds is that
they're independent of timezone or daylight-savings time.

One minus is that, being just numbers, they're not particularly human-readable
-- hence the to-string and from-string functions described below.  Another
caveat (not really a minus) is that _epoch milliseconds_, rather than epoch
seconds, are common in some contexts, particularly JavaScript. If you ever
(anywhere) see a timestamp for the year 49,000-something -- probably someone is
treating epoch-milliseconds as epoch-seconds.

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  print sec2gmt(1500000000);
  print sec2gmt(1500000000000);
}'
GENMD-EOF

You can get the current system time, as epoch-seconds, using the
[systime](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#systime) DSL function:

GENMD-CARDIFY-HIGHLIGHT-ONE
mlr --c2p --from example.csv put '$t = systime()'
color  shape    flag  k  index quantity rate   t
yellow triangle true  1  11    43.6498  9.8870 1634784588.045347
red    square   true  2  15    79.2778  0.0130 1634784588.045385
red    circle   true  3  16    13.8103  2.9010 1634784588.045386
red    square   false 4  48    77.5542  7.4670 1634784588.045393
purple triangle false 5  51    81.2290  8.5910 1634784588.045394

purple triangle false 7  65    80.1405  5.8240 1634784588.045418
yellow circle   true  8  73    63.9785  4.2370 1634784588.045419
yellow circle   true  9  87    63.5058  8.3350 1634784588.045421
purple square   false 10 91    72.3735  8.2430 1634784588.045422
GENMD-EOF

The [systimeint](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#systimeint) DSL function
is nothing more than a keystroke-saver for `int(systime())`.

## UTC times with standard format

One way to make epoch-seconds human-readable, while maintaining some of their
benefits such as being independent of timezone and daylight savings, is to use
the [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.  This was the
first (and initially only) human-readable date/time format supported by Miller
going all the way back to Miller 1.0.0.

You can get these from epoch-seconds using the 
[sec2gmt](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#sec2gmt) DSL function.
(Note that the terms _UTC_ and _GMT_ are used interchangeably in Miller.)
We also have [sec2gmtdate](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#sec2gmtdate) DSL function.

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  print sec2gmt(0);
  print sec2gmt(1234567890.123);
  print sec2gmt(-1234567890.123);
  print;
  print sec2gmtdate(0);
  print sec2gmtdate(1234567890.123);
  print sec2gmtdate(-1234567890.123);
}'
GENMD-EOF

## Local times with standard format; specifying timezones

You can use similar formatting for dates in your preferred timezone, not just UTC/GMT.
We have the
[sec2localtime](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#sec2localtime),
[sec2localdate](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#sec2localdate), and
[localtime2sec](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#localtime2sec) DSL functions.

You can specify the timezone using any of the following:

* An environment variable, e.g. `export TZ=Asia/Istanbul` at your system prompt (`set TZ=Asia/Istanbul` in Windows).
* Using the `--tz` flag. This sets the `TZ` environment variable, but only internally to the `mlr` process.
* Within a DSL expression, you can assign to `ENV["TZ"]`.
* By supplying an additional argument to any of the functions with `local` in their names.

Regardless, if you specify an invalid timezone, you'll be clearly notified:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND-TOLERATING-ERROR
mlr --from example.csv --tz This/Is/A/Typo cat
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
export TZ=Asia/Istanbul
mlr -n put 'end { print sec2localtime(0) }'
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --tz America/Sao_Paulo -n put 'end { print sec2localtime(0) }'
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  ENV["TZ"] = "Asia/Istanbul";
  print sec2localtime(0);
  print sec2localdate(0);
  print localtime2sec("2000-01-02 03:04:05");
  print;
  ENV["TZ"] = "America/Sao_Paulo";
  print sec2localtime(0);
  print sec2localdate(0);
  print localtime2sec("2000-01-02 03:04:05");
}'
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  print sec2localtime(0, 0, "Asia/Istanbul");
  print sec2localdate(0, "Asia/Istanbul");
  print localtime2sec("2000-01-02 03:04:05", "Asia/Istanbul");
  print;
  print sec2localtime(0, 0, "America/Sao_Paulo");
  print sec2localdate(0, "America/Sao_Paulo");
  print localtime2sec("2000-01-02 03:04:05", "America/Sao_Paulo");
}'
GENMD-EOF

Note that for local times, Miller omits the `T` and the `Z` you see in GMT times.

We also have the 
[gmt2localtime](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#gmt2localtime) and
[localtime2gmt](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#localtime2gmt) convenience functions:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  ENV["TZ"] = "Asia/Istanbul";
  print gmt2localtime("1970-01-01T00:00:00Z");
  print localtime2gmt("1970-01-01 00:00:00");
}'
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  print gmt2localtime("1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "America/Sao_Paulo");
  print gmt2localtime("1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "Asia/Istanbul");
  print localtime2gmt("1970-01-01 00:00:00",  "America/Sao_Paulo");
  print localtime2gmt("1970-01-01 00:00:00",  "Asia/Istanbul");
}'
GENMD-EOF

## Custom formats: strptime and strftime

The to-string and from-string functions we've seen so far are low-keystroking:
with a little bit of typing you can convert datetimes to/from epoch seconds.
The minus, however, is flexibility. This is where the
[strftime](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#strftime) and
[strptime](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#strptime) functions come into play.

Notes:

* The names `strftime` and `strptime` far predate Miller; they were chosen for familiarity. The `f` is for _format_: from epoch-seconds to human-readable string. The `p` is for _parse_: for doing the reverse.
* Even though Miller is written in Go as of Miller 6, it still largely preserves [C-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_date_and_time_functions#strftime) `strftime` and `strptime` semantics. As noted below, not all format strings used by the C library are recognized.
  * For `strftime`, this is thanks to [https://github.com/lestrrat-go/strftime](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/strftime), with a Miller-specific modification for fractional seconds.
  * For `strftime`, this is thanks to [https://github.com/pbnjay/strptime](https://github.com/pbnjay/strptime), with Miller-specific modifications.

Available format strings for `strftime`, taken directly from [https://github.com/lestrrat-go/strftime](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/strftime):

Examples:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  print strftime(0, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ");
  print strftime(0, "%FT%TZ");
}'
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  ENV["TZ"] = "Asia/Istanbul";
  print strftime(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");
  print strftime(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z");
  print strftime(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z");
  print strftime(0, "%A, %B %e, %Y");
  print strftime(123456789, "%I:%M %p");
}'
GENMD-EOF

Unfortunately, names from `%A` and `%B` are only available in English, as an artifact of a design
choice in the Go `time` library which Miller (and its `strftime` / `strptime` supporting packages as
noted above) rely on.

## A note on timezones

A note on timezones for `strptime`:

* Three-letter timezone names such as `CST` are recognized _only if you're in them_. (`UTC` is an exception.) This is because these aren't globally unique: `CST` can stand for `Central Standard Time`, `_Cuba Standard Time`, `_China Standard Time`, etc.
* Timezone specifiers which _are_ globally unique are of the form `-0400` and `+0500`.
* Specifiers like `-04:30`, `UTC-8`, and `Asia/Istanbul` were not supported in Miller 5 (which used the C `strptime` library), and are likewise not supported in Miller 6. See however the `TZ` environment-variable examples below.
* If you wish to match a final `Z` in the input, use a final `Z` in the format string. For example (see [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)) you can match the timestamp `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` using the format string `%FT%TZ`.

## Fractional seconds

For historical reasons, Miller's `strftime` and `strptime` use different format specifications for fractional seconds. Examples:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  print strftime(123456.789, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");
  print strftime(123456.789, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%1S");
  print strftime(123456.789, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%3S");
  print strftime(123456.789, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%6S");
  print strptime("1970-01-02 10:17:36.789000", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");
  print strptime("1970-01-02 10:17:36.789000", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f");
}'
GENMD-EOF

## strptime_local and strftime_local

We also have
[strftimelocal](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#strftimelocal) and
[strptimelocal](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#strptimelocal):

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  ENV["TZ"] = "America/Anchorage";
  print strftime_local(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z");
  print strftime_local(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z");
  print strftime_local(0, "%A, %B %e, %Y");
  print strptime_local("2020-03-01 00:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");
  print;
  ENV["TZ"] = "Asia/Hong_Kong";
  print strftime_local(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z");
  print strftime_local(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z");
  print strftime_local(0, "%A, %B %e, %Y");
  print strptime_local("2020-03-01 00:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");
}'
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {
  print strftime_local(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z", "America/Anchorage");
  print strftime_local(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z", "America/Anchorage");
  print strftime_local(0, "%A, %B %e, %Y",        "America/Anchorage");
  print strptime_local("2020-03-01 00:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", "America/Anchorage");
  print;
  print strftime_local(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z", "Asia/Hong_Kong");
  print strftime_local(0, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z", "Asia/Hong_Kong");
  print strftime_local(0, "%A, %B %e, %Y",        "Asia/Hong_Kong");
  print strptime_local("2020-03-01 00:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", "Asia/Hong_Kong");
}'
GENMD-EOF

## Relative times

You can get the seconds since the Miller process start using
[uptime](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#uptime):

GENMD-CARDIFY-HIGHLIGHT-ONE

GENMD-EOF

Time-differences can be done in seconds, of course; you can also use the following if you like:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -F | grep hms
