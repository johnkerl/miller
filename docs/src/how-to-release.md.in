# How to create a new release

This is my checklist for making new releases.

In this example I am using version 6.2.0 to 6.3.0; of course that will change for subsequent revisions.

* Update version found in `mlr --version` and `man mlr`:

    * Edit `pkg/version/version.go` from `6.2.0-dev` to `6.3.0`.
    * Edit `miller.spec`: `Version`, and `changelog` entry
    * Run `make dev` in the Miller repo base directory
    * The ordering in this makefile rule is important: the first build creates `mlr`; the second runs `mlr` to create `manpage.txt`; the third includes `manpage.txt` into one of its outputs.
    * Commit and push.

* If Go version is being updated: edit all three of

  * `go.mod`
  * `.github/workflows/go.yml`
  * `.github/workflows/release.yml`

* Create the release tarball:

    * `make release_tarball`
    * This creates `miller-6.3.0.tar.gz` which we'll upload to GitHub, the URL of which will be in our `miller.spec`
    * Prepare the source RPM following [README-RPM.md](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/README-RPM.md).

* Create the Github release tag:

    * Don't forget the `v` in `v6.3.0`
    * Write the release notes -- save as a pre-release until below
        * Be sure the commit being used is the (non-`main`) PR commit containing the new version, or, `main` after that PR is merged back to `main`. (Otherwise, the release will be tagging the commit _before_ the changes, and `mlr version` will not show the new release number.)
    * Thanks to [PR 822](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/pull/822) which introduces [goreleaser](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/.goreleaser.yml) there are versions for many platforms auto-built and auto-attached to the GitHub release.
    * Attach the release tarball and SRPM. Double-check assets were successfully uploaded.
    * Publish the release in pre-release mode, until all CI jobs finish successfully. Note that gorelease will create and attach the rest of the binaries.
    * Before marking the release as public, download an executable from among the generated binaries and make sure its `mlr version` prints what you expect -- else, restart this process.
    * Then mark the release as public.

* Build the release-specific docs:

    * Note: the GitHub release above created a tag `v6.3.0` which is correct. Here we'll create a branch named `6.3.0` which is also correct.
    * Create a branch `6.3.0` (not `v6.3.0`). Locally: `git checkout -b 6.3.0`, then `git push`.
    * Edit `docs/mkdocs.yml`, replacing "Miller Dev Documentation" with "Miller 6.3.0 Documentation". Commit and push.
    * At the Miller Read the Docs admin page, [https://readthedocs.org/projects/miller](https://readthedocs.org/projects/miller), in the Versions tab, scroll down to _Activate a version_, then activate 6.3.0.
    * In the Admin tab, in Advanced Settings, set the Default Version and Default Branch both to 6.3.0. Scroll to the end of the page and poke Save.
    * In the Builds tab, if they're not already building,  build 6.3.0 as well as latest.
    * Verify that [https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.0](https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.0) now exists.
    * Verify that [https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest](https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest) (with hard page-reload) shows _Miller 6.8.0 Documentation_ in the upper left of the doc pages.

* Notify:

    * Submit `brew` pull request; notify any other distros which don't appear to have autoupdated since the previous release (notes below)
    * Similarly for `macports`: [https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/blob/master/textproc/miller/Portfile](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/blob/master/textproc/miller/Portfile)
    * See also [README-versions.md](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/README-versions.md) -- distros usually catch up over time but some contacts/pings never hurt to kick-start processes after owners move on from a project they started.
    * Social-media updates.
    * Brew notes:

        * [How to submit a version upgrade](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md#to-submit-a-version-upgrade-for-the-foo-formula)
        * `brew bump-formula-pr --force --strict miller --url https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/releases/download/v6.2.0/miller-6.2.0.tar.gz --sha256 xxx` with `xxx` from `shasum -a 256 miller-6.2.0.tar.gz`.

* Afterwork:

    * Edit `pkg/version/version.go` to change version from `6.3.0` to `6.3.0-dev`.
    * `make dev`
    * Commit and push.
