# What's new in Miller 6

## User experience

Features are driven largely by great feedback in the [2021 Miller User Survey results](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/discussions/670) and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues?q=is%3Aissue).

TL;DRs: [install](installing-miller.md), [binaries](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/releases/tag/v6.0.0), [compatibility with Miller 5](#changes-from-miller-5).

### Performance

Performance is on par with Miller 5 for simple processing, and is far better than Miller 5 for
complex processing chains -- the latter due to improved multicore utilization. CSV I/O is notably
improved.  See the [Performance benchmarks](#performance-benchmarks) section at the bottom of this
page for details.

### Documentation improvements

Documentation (what you're reading here) and online help (`mlr --help`) have been completely reworked.

In the initial release, the focus was convincing users already familiar with
`awk`/`grep`/`cut` that Miller was a viable alternative -- but over time it's
become clear that many Miller users aren't expert with those tools. The focus
has shifted toward a higher quantity of more introductory/accessible material
for command-line data processing.

Similarly, the FAQ/recipe material has been expanded to include more, and
simpler, use-cases including resolved questions from
[Miller Issues](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues)
and
[Miller Discussions](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/discussions);
more complex/niche material has been pushed farther down. The long reference
pages have been split up into separate pages. (See also
[Structure of these documents](structure-of-these-documents.md).)

One of the main feedback themes from the 2021 Miller User Survey was that some
things should be easier to find. Namely, on each doc page there's now a banner
across the top with things that should be one click away from the landing page
(or any page): command-line flags, verbs, functions, glossary/acronyms, and a
finder for docs by release.

Since CSV is overwhelmingly the most popular data format for Miller, it is
now discussed first, and more examples use CSV.

### Improved Windows experience

Stronger support for Windows (with or without MSYS2), with a couple of
exceptions.  See [Miller on Windows](miller-on-windows.md) for more information.

Binaries are reliably available using GitHub Actions: see also [Installation](installing-miller.md).

### Output colorization

Miller uses separate, customizable colors for keys and values whenever the output is to a terminal. See [Output Colorization](output-colorization.md).

### Improved command-line parsing

Miller 6 has getoptish command-line parsing ([pull request 467](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/pull/467)):

* `-xyz` expands automatically to `-x -y -z`, so (for example) `mlr cut -of shape,flag` is the same as `mlr cut -o -f shape,flag`.
* `--foo=bar` expands automatically to  `--foo bar`, so (for example) `mlr --ifs=comma` is the same as `mlr --ifs comma`.
* `--mfrom`, `--load`, `--mload` as described in the [flags reference](reference-main-flag-list.md#miscellaneous-flags).

A small but nice item: since **mlr --csv** and **mlr --json** are so common, you can now use alternate shorthands **mlr -c** and **mlr -j**, respectively.

### Improved error messages for DSL parsing

For `mlr put` and `mlr filter`, parse-error messages now include location information:

GENMD-CARDIFY
mlr: cannot parse DSL expression.
Parse error on token ">" at line 63 column 7.
GENMD-EOF

### Scripting

Scripting is now easier -- support for `#!` with `sh`, as always, along with now support for `#!` with `mlr -s`. For
Windows, `mlr -s` can also be used.  These help reduce backslash-clutter and let you do more while typing less.
See the [scripting page](scripting.md).

### REPL

Miller now has a read-evaluate-print-loop ([REPL](repl.md)) where you can single-step through your data-file record,
express arbitrary statements to converse with the data, etc.

GENMD-CARDIFY-HIGHLIGHT-ONE
mlr repl

[mlr] 1 + 2
3

[mlr] apply([1,2,3,4,5], func(e) {return e ** 3})
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125]

[mlr] :open example.csv

[mlr] :read

[mlr] $*
{
  "color": "yellow",
  "shape": "triangle",
  "flag": "true",
  "k": 1,
  "index": 11,
  "quantity": 43.6498,
  "rate": 9.8870
}

GENMD-EOF

## Localization and internationalization

### Improved internationalization support

You can now write field names, local variables, etc. all in UTF-8, e.g.  `mlr
--c2p filter '$σχήμα == "κύκλος"' παράδειγμα.csv`. See the
[internationalization page](internationalization.md) for examples.

### Improved datetime/timezone support

Including support for specifying timezone via function arguments, as an alternative to
the `TZ` environment variable. Please see [DSL datetime/timezone functions](reference-dsl-time.md).

## Data ingestion

### In-process support for compressed input

In addition to `--prepipe gunzip`, you can now use the `--gzin` flag. In fact, if your files end in `.gz` you don't even need to do that -- Miller will autodetect by file extension and automatically uncompress `mlr --csv cat foo.csv.gz`. Similarly for `.z` and `.bz2` files.  Please see the page on [Compressed data](reference-main-compressed-data.md) for more information.

### Support for reading web URLs

You can read input with prefixes `https://`, `http://`, and `file://`:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr --csv sort -f shape \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnkerl/miller/main/docs/src/gz-example.csv.gz
GENMD-EOF

## Data processing

### Improved JSON / JSON Lines support, and arrays

Arrays are now supported in Miller's `put`/`filter` programming language, as
described in the [Arrays reference](reference-main-arrays.md). (Also, `array` is
now a keyword so this is no longer usable as a local-variable or UDF name.)

JSON support is improved:

* Direct support for arrays means that you can now use Miller to process more JSON files than ever before.
* Streamable JSON parsing: Miller's internal record-processing pipeline starts as soon as the first record is read (which was already the case for other file formats). This means that, unless records are wrapped with outermost `[...]`, Miller now handles JSON / JSON Lines in `tail -f` contexts like it does for other file formats.
* Flatten/unflatten -- conversion of JSON nested data structures (arrays and/or maps in record values) to/from non-JSON formats is a powerful new feature, discussed in the page [Flatten/unflatten: JSON vs. tabular formats](flatten-unflatten.md).
* Since types are better handled now, the workaround flags `--jvquoteall` and `--jknquoteint` no longer have meaning -- although they're accepted as no-ops at the command line for backward compatibility.
  * Update: `--jvquoteall` was restored shortly after 6he 6.4.0 release.

JSON vs JSON Lines:

* Miller 5 accepted input records either with or without enclosing `[...]`; on output, by default it produced single-line records without outermost `[...]`.  Miller 5 let you customize output formatting using `--jvstack` (multi-line records) and `--jlistwrap` (write outermost `[...]`). _Thus, Miller 5's JSON output format, with default flags, was in fact [JSON Lines](file-formats.md#json-lines) all along._
* In Miller 6, [JSON Lines](file-formats.md#json-lines) is acknowledged explicitly.
* On input, your records are accepted whether or not they have outermost `[...]`, and regardless of line breaks, whether the specified input format is JSON or JSON Lines. (This is similar to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).)
* With `--ojson`, output records are written multiline (pretty-printed), with outermost `[...]`.
* With `--ojsonl`, output records are written single-line, without outermost `[...]`.
* This makes `--jvstack` and `--jlistwrap` unnecessary. However, if you want outermost `[...]` with single-line records, you can use `--ojson --no-jvstack`.

See also the [Arrays reference](reference-main-arrays.md) for more information.

### Improved numeric conversion

The most central part of Miller 6 is a deep refactor of how data values are parsed
from file contents, how types are inferred, and how they're converted back to
text into output files.

This was all initiated by [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/151](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/151).

In Miller 5 and below, all values were stored as strings, then only converted
to int/float as-needed, for example when a particular field was referenced in
the `stats1` or `put` verbs. This led to awkwardnesses such as the `-S`
and `-F` flags for `put` and `filter`.

In Miller 6, things parseable as int/float are treated as such from the moment
the input data is read, and these are passed along through the verb chain.  All
values are typed from when they're read, and their types are passed along.
Meanwhile the original string representation of each value is also retained. If
a numeric field isn't modified during the processing chain, it's printed out
the way it arrived. Also, quoted values in JSON strings are flagged as being
strings throughout the processing chain.

For example (see [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/178](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/178)) you can now do

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
echo '{ "a": "0123" }' | mlr --json cat
GENMD-EOF

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
echo '{ "x": 1.230, "y": 1.230000000 }' | mlr --json cat
GENMD-EOF

### Deduping of repeated field names

By default, field names are deduped for all file formats except JSON / JSON Lines. So if you
have an input record with `x=8,x=9` then the second field's key is renamed to
`x_2` and so on -- the record scans as `x=8,x_2=9`. Use `mlr
--no-dedupe-field-names` to suppress this, and have the record be scanned as
`x=9`.

For JSON and JSON Lines, the last duplicated key in an input record is always retained,
regardless of `mlr --no-dedupe-field-names`: `{"x":8,"x":9}` scans as if it
were `{"x":9}`.

### Regex support for IFS and IPS

You can now split fields on whitespace when whitespace is a mix of tabs and
spaces.  As well, you can use regular expressions for the input field-separator
and the input pair-separator.  Please see the section on
[multi-character and regular-expression separators](reference-main-separators.md#multi-character-and-regular-expression-separators).

In particular, for NIDX format, the default IFS now allows splitting on one or more of space or tab.

### Case-folded sorting options

The [sort](reference-verbs.md#sort) verb now accepts `-c` and `-cr` options for case-folded ascending/descending sort, respetively.

### New DSL functions / operators

* Higher-order functions [`select`](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#select), [`apply`](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#apply), [`reduce`](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#reduce), [`fold`](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#fold), and [`sort`](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#sort).  See the [sorting page](sorting.md) and the [higher-order-functions page](reference-dsl-higher-order-functions.md) for more information.

* Absent-coalesce operator [`??`](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#absent-coalesce) along with `??=`;
absent-empty-coalesce operator [`???`](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#absent-empty-coalesce) along with `???=`.

* The dot operator is not new, but it has a new role: in addition to its existing use for string-concatenation like `"a"."b" = "ab"`, you can now also use it for keying maps. For example, `$req.headers.host` is the same as `$req["headers"]["host"]`. See the [dot-operator reference](reference-dsl-operators.md#the-double-purpose-dot-operator) for more information.

* String-hashing functions [md5](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#md5), [sha1](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#sha1), [sha256](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#sha256), and [sha512](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#sha512).

* Platform-property functions [hostname](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#hostname), [os](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#os), and [version](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#version).

* Unsigned right-shift [`>>>`](reference-dsl-builtin-functions.md#ursh) along with `>>>=`.

## Changes from Miller 5

The following differences are rather technical. If they don't sound familiar to you, not to worry! Most users won't be affected by the (relatively minor) changes between Miller 5 and Miller 6.

**Please drop an issue at [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues) with any/all backward-compatibility concerns between Miller 5 and Miller 6.**

### Line endings

The `--auto` flag is now ignored. Before, if a file had CR/LF (Windows-style) line endings on input (on any platform), it would have the same on output; likewise, LF (Unix-style) line endings. Now, files with CR/LF or LF line endings are processed on any platform, but the output line-ending is for the platform. E.g. reading CR/LF files on Linux will now produce LF output.

### IFS and IPS as regular expressions

IFS and IPS can be regular expressions now. Please see the section on [multi-character and regular-expression separators](reference-main-separators.md#multi-character-and-regular-expression-separators).

### JSON and JSON Lines formatting

* `--jknquoteint` and `jquoteall` are ignored; they were workarounds for the (now much-improved) type-inference and type-tracking in Miller 6.
* `--json-fatal-arrays-on-input`, `--json-map-arrays-on-input`, and `--json-skip-arrays-on-input` are ignored; Miller 6 now supports arrays fully.
* See also `mlr help legacy-flags` or the [legacy-flags reference](reference-main-flag-list.md#legacy-flags).
* Miller 5 accepted input records either with or without enclosing `[...]`; on output, by default it produced single-line records without outermost `[...]`.  Miller 5 let you customize output formatting using `--jvstack` (multi-line records) and `--jlistwrap` (write outermost `[...]`). _Thus, Miller 5's JSON output format, with default flags, was in fact [JSON Lines](file-formats.md#json-lines) all along._
* In Miller 6, [JSON Lines](file-formats.md#json-lines) is acknowledged explicitly.
* On input, your records are accepted whether or not they have outermost `[...]`, and regardless of line breaks, whether the specified input format is JSON or JSON Lines. (This is similar to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).)
* With `--ojson`, output records are written multiline (pretty-printed), with outermost `[...]`.
* With `--ojsonl`, output records are written single-line, without outermost `[...]`.
* This makes `--jvstack` and `--jlistwrap` unnecessary. However, if you want outermost `[...]` with single-line records, you can use `--ojson --no-jvstack`.
* Miller 5 tolerated trailing commas, which are not compliant with the JSON specification: for example, `{"x":1,"y":2,}`. Miller 6 uses a JSON parser which is compliant with the JSON specification and does not accept trailing commas.

### Type-inference

* The `-S` and `-F` flags to `mlr put` and `mlr filter` are ignored, since type-inference is no longer done in `mlr put` and `mlr filter`, but rather, when records are first read. You can use `mlr -S` and `mlr -A`, respectively, instead to control type-inference within the record-readers.
* Octal numbers like `0123` and `07` are type-inferred as string. Use `mlr -O` to infer them as octal integers. Note that `08` and `09` will then infer as decimal integers.
* Any numbers prefix with `0o`, e.g. `0o377`, are already treated as octal regardless of `mlr -O` -- `mlr -O` only affects how leading-zero integers are handled.
* See also the [miscellaneous-flags reference](reference-main-flag-list.md#miscellaneous-flags).

### Emit statements

Variables must be non-indexed on `emit`. To emit an indexed variable now requires the new `emit1` keyword.

This worked in Miller 5 but is no longer supported in Miller 6:

GENMD-CARDIFY-HIGHLIGHT-ONE
mlr5 -n put 'end {@input={"a":1}; emit @input["a"]}'
input=1
GENMD-EOF

This works in Miller 6 (and worked in Miller 5 as well) and is supported:

GENMD-RUN-COMMAND
mlr -n put 'end {@input={"a":1}; emit1 {"input":@input["a"]}}'
GENMD-EOF

Please see the [section on emit statements](reference-dsl-output-statements.md#emit1-and-emitemitpemitf)
for more information.

## Developer-specific aspects

* Miller has been ported from C to Go. Developer notes: [https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/README-dev.md](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/README-dev.md).
* Regression testing has been completely reworked, including regression-testing now running fully on Windows (alongside Linux and Mac) [on each GitHub commit](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/actions).

## Performance benchmarks

For performance testing, the [example.csv](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/docs/src/example.csv) file
[was expanded](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/scripts/make-big-files) into a million-line CSV file,
then converted to DKVP, JSON, etc.

Notes:

* These benchmarks were run on two laptops: a commodity Mac laptop with four CPUs, on MacOS Monterey, using `go1.16.5 darwin/amd64`, and a commodity Linux Lenovo with eight CPUs, on Ubuntu 21.10, using `go1.17.5 linux/amd64`.
* Interestingly, I noted a significant slowdown -- for this particular Linux laptop on low battery -- for the Go version but not the C version. Perhaps multicore interacts with power-saving mode.
* As of late 2021, Miller has been benchmarked using Go compiler versions 1.15.15, 1.16.12, 1.17.5, and 1.18beta1, with no significant performance changes attributable to compiler versions.

For the [first benchmark](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/scripts/chain-cmps.sh), the format is CSV and the operations are varied:

**Mac**

| Operation | Miller 5 | Miller 6 | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CSV check | 1.541 | 1.216 | 1.27x |
| CSV cat | 2.403 | 1.430 | 1.68x |
| CSV tail | 1.526 | 1.222 | 1.25x |
| CSV tac | 2.785 | 3.122 | 0.89x |
| CSV sort -f shape | 2.996 | 3.139 | 0.95x |
| CSV sort -n quantity | 4.895 | 5.200 | 0.94x |
| CSV stats1 | 2.955 | 1.865 | 1.58x |
| CSV put expressions | 5.642 | 2.577 | 2.19x |

**Linux**

| Operation | Miller 5 | Miller 6 | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CSV check | 0.680 | 1.104 | 0.62x |
| CSV cat | 1.066 | 1.231 | 0.87x |
| CSV tail | 0.691 | 1.130 | 0.61x |
| CSV tac | 1.648 | 2.620 | 0.63x |
| CSV sort -f shape | 2.087 | 2.953 | 0.71x |
| CSV sort -n quantity | 5.588 | 5.337 | 1.05x |
| CSV stats1 | 2.376 | 1.751 | 1.36x |
| CSV put expressions | 4.520 | 2.091 | 2.16x |

For the [second benchmark](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/scripts/time-big-files), we have `mlr cat` of those files, varying file types, with processing times shown. Catting out files as-is isn't a particularly useful operation in itself, but it gives an idea of how processing time depends on file format:

**Mac**

| Format   | Miller 5 | Miller 6 | Speedup |
| ---      | ---      | ---      | ---     |
| CSV      | 2.393    | 1.493    | 1.60x   |
| CSV-lite | 1.644    | 1.351    | 1.22x   |
| DKVP     | 2.418    | 1.920    | 1.26x   |
| NIDX     | 1.053    | 0.958    | 1.10x   |
| XTAB     | 4.978    | 2.003    | 2.49x   |
| JSON     | 10.966   | 10.569   | 1.04x   |

**Linux**

| Format   | Miller 5 | Miller 6 | Speedup |
| ---      | ---      | ---      | ---     |
| CSV      | 1.069    | 1.157    | 0.92x   |
| CSV-lite | 0.640    | 1.187    | 0.54x   |
| DKVP     | 1.017    | 1.853    | 0.55x   |
| NIDX     | 0.623    | 1.398    | 0.45x   |
| XTAB     | 2.159    | 1.893    | 1.14x   |
| JSON     | 5.077    | 10.445   | 0.49x   |

For the [third benchmark](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/blob/main/scripts/chain-lengths.sh), we have longer and longer then-chains: `mlr put ...`, then `mlr put ... then put ...`, etc. -- deepening the then-chain from one to six:

**Mac**

| Chain length | Miller 5 | Miller 6 | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 5.709 | 2.567 | 2.22x |
| 2 | 8.926 | 3.110 | 2.87x |
| 3 | 11.915 | 3.712 | 3.21x |
| 4 | 15.093 | 4.391 | 3.44x |
| 5 | 18.209 | 5.090 | 3.58x |
| 6 | 21.109 | 6.032 | 3.50x |

**Linux**

| Chain length | Miller 5 | Miller 6 | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4.732 | 2.106 | 2.25x |
| 2 | 8.103 | 2.992 | 2.71x |
| 3 | 11.42 | 3.4743 | 3.29x |
| 4 | 14.904 | 3.859 | 3.86x |
| 5 | 18.128 | 4.1563 | 4.36x |
| 6 | 21.827 | 4.512 | 4.84x |

Notes:

* CSV processing is particularly improved in Miller 6.
* Record I/O is improved across the board, except that JSON continues to be a CPU-intensive format. Miller 6 JSON throughput is the same on Mac and Linux; Miller 5 did better than Miller 6 but only on Linux, not Mac.
* Miller 6's `sort` merits more performance analysis.
* Even single-verb processing with `put` and `stats1` is significantly faster on both platforms.
* Longer then-chains benefit even more from Miller 6's [multicore approach](cpu.md).
