sec2gmtdate
Usage: ../c/mlr sec2gmtdate {comma-separated list of field names}
Replaces a numeric field representing seconds since the epoch with the
corresponding GMT year-month-day timestamp; leaves non-numbers as-is.
This is nothing more than a keystroke-saver for the sec2gmtdate function:
  ../c/mlr sec2gmtdate time1,time2
is the same as
  ../c/mlr put '$time1=sec2gmtdate($time1);$time2=sec2gmtdate($time2)'
sec2gmt
Usage: mlr sec2gmt [options] {comma-separated list of field names}
Replaces a numeric field representing seconds since the epoch with the
corresponding GMT timestamp; leaves non-numbers as-is. This is nothing
more than a keystroke-saver for the sec2gmt function:
  mlr sec2gmt time1,time2
is the same as
  mlr put '$time1 = sec2gmt($time1); $time2 = sec2gmt($time2)'
Options:
-1 through -9: format the seconds using 1..9 decimal places, respectively.
--millis Input numbers are treated as milliseconds since the epoch.
--micros Input numbers are treated as microseconds since the epoch.
--nanos  Input numbers are treated as nanoseconds since the epoch.
