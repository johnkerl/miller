# These steps are done in a particular order:
# go:
# * builds the mlr executable
# man:
# * creates manpage mlr.1 and manpage.txt using mlr from the $PATH
# * copies the latter to docs/src
# docs:
# * turns *.md.in into *.md (live code samples), using mlr from the $PATH
# * note the man/manpage.txt becomes some of the HTML content
# * turns *.md into docs/site HTML and CSS files
